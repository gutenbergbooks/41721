<h1 title="">THE CRIMSON FLASH</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><br />CHAPTER I
<br />JOHNNY LOSES A FIGHT</h2>
<p>In the center of the &ldquo;big top,&rdquo; which sheltered
the mammoth three-ring circus, brass horns
blared to the rhythmic beat of a huge bass
drum.</p>
<p>Eight trained elephants, giant actors of the
sawdust ring, patiently stood in line, awaiting
the command to make way for the tumblers,
trapeze performers, bareback riders and the
queen of the circus.</p>
<p>The twins, Marjory and Margaret MacDonald,
just past ten years of age, and attending
their first circus, stood pressed against the rope
not an arm&rsquo;s length from the foremost elephant.
Suddenly the gigantic creature reached out a
beseeching trunk for a possible peanut.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>Sensing danger, Johnny Thompson, the one-time
lightweight boxing champion, who, besides
their maid, stood guard over the millionaire
twins, sprang forward. Quick as he was, his
movement was far too slow. Marjory jumped
back; there was an almost inaudible snap. The
elephant stretched his trunk to full length&mdash;then
in apparent anger uttered a hollow snort.</p>
<p>A broad bar of sunlight shooting over the top
of the canvas wall was cut by a sudden flash.
The flash described a circle, then blinked out at
the feet of three waiting young women performers.</p>
<p>With a cry of consternation on his lips,
Johnny Thompson sprang over the ropes. Bowling
over an elephant trainer in his haste, he
bolted toward the three girl acrobats at whose
feet the miniature meteor had vanished.</p>
<p>Again his agile movement was far too slow.
Six pairs of rough hands tried to seize him.
Johnny&rsquo;s right shot out. With a little gurgle, an
attendant in uniform staggered backward to
crumple in the sawdust. A ring-master, leaping
like a panther, landed on Johnny&rsquo;s back.
Dropping abruptly, Johnny executed a somersault,
shook himself free and rose only to butt
his head into the stomach of a fat clown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>And then what promised to be a beautiful
scrap ended miserably. A razor-back, or tent
roustabout, struck Johnny on the head with a
tent stake. Johnny dropped like an empty meal
sack. At once four attendants dragged him beneath
the tent wall into a shady corner. There,
after tying his hands and feet, they waited for
his return to consciousness.</p>
<p>Little by little Johnny came to himself, and
began to fumble at his fetters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! What hit me?&rdquo; he grumbled, as he
attempted to rub his bruised head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fell and struck your head on a tent
pole,&rdquo; grinned a razor-back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some scrapper, eh?&rdquo; a second man commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dope or moonshine?&rdquo; asked a third.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; exclaimed Johnny. &ldquo;It was&mdash;darn
it! No. That&rsquo;s none of your business.
But I&rsquo;ll get it back if I have to follow this one-horse
show from Boston to Texas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t follow nothin&rsquo; just at present,&rdquo;
scowled the razor-back, eying his shackles with
satisfaction. &ldquo;That guy you hit had to go to
the show&rsquo;s surgeon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; ejaculated his companion. &ldquo;And
I bet this little feller doesn&rsquo;t weigh a hundred
and ten stripped! How&rsquo;d he do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me loose and I&rsquo;ll give you a free exhibition,&rdquo;
grinned Johnny, as he settled back, resolved
to take what was coming to him with a
smile.</p>
<p>He was not a quarrelsome fellow, this Johnny
Thompson. He had studied the science of boxing
and wrestling because it interested him, and
because he wished to be able to take care of
himself in every emergency. He never struck
a man unless forced to do so. The emergency
of the past hour had spurred him to unusual
activity. In a way he regretted it now, but on
reflection decided that were the same set of
conditions to confront him again, his actions
would probably be the same. His one regret
was that he had been unable to attain his end.
His only problem now was to recover lost ground
and to reach the desired goal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>Late that night, with stiffened joints and aching
muscles, he made his way to the desolate
spot where but a few hours before a hilarious
throng had laughed at the antics of clowns and
thrilled at the daring dance of the tight-rope
walker.</p>
<p>In his hand Johnny held a small flashlight.
This he flicked about here and there for some
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; he exclaimed at last. &ldquo;This is
the very spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dropping on hands and knees he began clawing
over the sawdust. Running it through his
fingers, he gathered it in little piles here and
there until presently the place resembled a miniature
mountain range. He had been at this for
a half hour when he straightened up with a
sigh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;not a solitary
chance! One of those circus dames got it;
the trapeze performer, or maybe the tight-rope
walker. Which one? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve got to
find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly he leaped to his feet. A long-drawn-out
whistle sounded through the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The circus train! I&rsquo;ve just time to jump it.
I&rsquo;ll stow away on her. How&rsquo;s that? A circus
stowaway!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny dashed across the open space and, just
as the train began to move, caught at the iron
bars of a gondola car loaded with tent equipment.
Climbing aboard, he groped about until
he found a soft spot among some piles of canvas,
and, sinking down there, was soon fast
asleep. He had had no supper, but that mattered
little. He would eat a double portion of
ham and eggs in the morning. It was enough
that he was on his way. Where to? He did
not exactly know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>When Johnny leaped over the rope in the
circus tent the previous afternoon, in his rush
toward the lady performers, he had dodged behind
the trained elephants. This took him out
of the view of the twins, Marjory and Margaret.
So interested were they in the elephants that
they did not miss him, and not having noted the
sparkle in the sunlight which sent Johnny on his
mad chase, they remained fully occupied in
watching the regular events of the circus.</p>
<p>The elephants had lumbered into the side tent,
the tight-rope walker had danced her airy way
across the arena, the brown bear had taken his
daily bicycle ride, and the human statuary was
on display, when Marjory suddenly turned to
Margaret and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Johnny&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he is,&rdquo; said the other twin. &ldquo;Perhaps he
didn&rsquo;t like it. He&rsquo;ll be back, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid was quite accustomed to looking
after the millionaire twins, so when Johnny
failed to put in an appearance at the end of the
performance, they passed out with the throng,
the maid hailed a taxi and they were soon on
their way home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>It was then that Marjory, looking down, noticed
that the fine gold chain about her neck hung
with two loose ends. Catching her breath, she
uttered a startled whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oo! Look! Margaret! It&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margaret looked once, then clasped her hands
in horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And father said you mustn&rsquo;t take it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was our first, our very first circus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; sighed Margaret. &ldquo;And wasn&rsquo;t it
just grand! But now,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;now, you&rsquo;ll
have to tell father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will&mdash;right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marjory did tell. They had not been in the
house a minute before she told of their loss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Johnny Thompson?&rdquo; their father
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t seen him for two hours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that settles it. I might have known
when I hired an adventurer to look after my
thoroughbreds and guard my children that I&rsquo;d
be sorry. But he was a splendid man with the
horses; seemed to think of &rsquo;em as his own; and
as for boxing, I never saw a fellow like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and Daddy, we liked him,&rdquo; chimed in
Marjory. &ldquo;We liked him a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the father said thoughtfully, &ldquo;guess
I ought to put a man on his trail and bring him
back. Probably went off with the circus. But
I won&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s been a soldier, and a good one,
I&rsquo;m told. That excuses a lot. And then if you
go dangling a few thousand dollars on a bit of
gold chain, what can you expect? Better go get
your supper and then run on to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night, before they crept into their twin
beds, Marjory and Margaret talked long and
earnestly over something very important.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Marjory at last, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll find some
real circus clothes somewhere. Then we&rsquo;ll have
Prince and Blackie saddled and bridled. Then
we&rsquo;ll ride off to find that old circus and bring
Johnny Thompson back. We can&rsquo;t get along
without him; besides, he didn&rsquo;t take it. I just
know he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And if he did, he didn&rsquo;t mean to,&rdquo; supplemented
Margaret.</p>
<p>A moment later they were both sound asleep.</p>
<p>As Johnny Thompson bumped along in his
rail gondola, with the click-click of the wheels
keeping time to the distant pant of the engine,
he dreamed a madly fantastic dream. In it he
felt the nerve-benumbing shudder which comes
with the shock of a train wreck. He felt himself
lifted high in air to fall among rolls of canvas
and piles of tent poles, heard the crash of
breaking timbers, the scream of grinding ironwork,
and above it all the roar of frightened animals&mdash;tigers,
lions, panthers, tossed, still in
their cages, to be buried beneath the wreckage,
or hurled free to tumble down the embankment.
In this dream Johnny crawled from beneath the
canvas to find himself staring into the red and
gleaming eye of some great cat that was stalking
him as its prey. He struggled to draw his
clasp knife from his pocket, and in that mad
struggle awoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>With every nerve alert he caught the click-click
of wheels, the distant pant of the engine.
It had been nothing more than a dream. He
was still traveling steadily forward with the
circus.</p>
<p>Yet, as he settled back, he gave an involuntary
shudder and, propping himself on one
elbow, stared through the darkness toward the
spot where, in his dream, the great cat had
crouched. To his horror, he caught the red
gleam of a single burning eye.</p>
<p>Instantly there flashed through his mind the
row of great caged cats he had seen that day.
Pacing the floor of their dens, pausing now and
again for a leap, a growl, a snarl, they had fascinated
him then. Now his blood ran cold at
the thought of the creature which, having
escaped from its cage, had crept along the
swinging cars, leaping lightly from one to the
other until the scent of a man had arrested its
course. Was it the Senegal lion? Johnny
doubted that. Perhaps the tawny yellow Bengal
tiger, or the more magnificent one from Siberia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>All this time, while his mind had worked with
the speed of a wireless, Johnny&rsquo;s hand was struggling
to free his clasp knife.</p>
<p>Once more his eye sought the ball of fire.
Suddenly as it had come, so suddenly it had
vanished. He started in astonishment. Yet he
was not to be deceived. The creature had turned
its head. It was moving. Perhaps at this very
moment it was crouching for a spring. A huge
pile of canvas loomed above Johnny. A leap
from this vantage, the tearing of claws, the
sinking of fangs, and this circus train would
have witnessed a tragedy.</p>
<p>He strained his ears for a sound, but heard
none. He strove to make out a bulk in the dark,
but saw nothing. Could it be a tiger or mountain
lion, jaguar or spotted leopard? Or was
it the black leopard from Asia? A fresh chill
ran down Johnny&rsquo;s spine at thought of this creature.
Other great cats had paced their cages,
growled, snarled; the black leopard, smaller than
any, but muscular, sharp clawed, keen fanged,
with glowering eyes, had lurked in the corner
of his cage and gloomed at those who passed.
It was this animal that Johnny feared the most.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>If he but had a light! At once he thought of
his small electric torch. Grasping it in his left
hand, he leveled it at the spot where the burning
eye had been, and gripping the clasp knife
in his right, threw on the button.</p>
<p>As the shaft of light flashed across the canvas,
he stared for a second, then his hand trembled
with surprise and excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Panther Eye, as I live!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You
old rascal! What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The former companion, for it was not a great
cat, but a man, and none other than Panther
Eye, fellow free-lance in many a previous adventure,
stared at him through large smoked
glasses, a smile playing over his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny Thompson, I&rsquo;ll be bound! Some luck
to you. What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking for something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll stay with this circus until I find it,&rdquo;
said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here, Johnny. Shake on it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>Pant crawled over the swaying car and extended
a hand. Johnny shook it solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slept any?&rdquo; asked Pant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better sleep some more, hadn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant crept back to his hole in the canvas;
Johnny sank back into his. He was not to sleep
at once, however. His mind was working on
many problems. Not the least of these was the
question of Panther Eye&rsquo;s presence on the circus
train. This strange fellow, who appeared to
be endowed with a capacity for seeing in the
dark, was always delving in dark corners,
searching out hidden mysteries. What mystery
could there be about a circus? What, indeed?
Was not Johnny on the trail of a puzzling mystery
himself?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>Having reasoned thus far he was about to
fall asleep, when a single red flash lighted up the
peak of the canvas pile, then faded. He thought
of the red ball of fire he had taken for a cat&rsquo;s
eye. He remembered the yellow glow he had
seen when with Pant on other occasions. His
mind attacked the problem weakly. He was half
asleep. In another second the click-click of the
car wheels was heard only in his dreams.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br />CHAPTER II
<br />BOXING THE BUNCO-STEERER</h2>
<p>From time to time during the night, Johnny
awoke to listen for a moment to the click-click
of the wheels. Once he thought he caught again
the play of that crimson flash upon the canvas.
Once he remained awake long enough to do a
little wondering and planning. How had Pant,
his friend of other days, come aboard this circus
train? What was he seeking? True, Johnny
had received a letter from this strange fellow
some time before, in which he spoke in mysterious
terms of a three-ring circus and the Secret
Service, but Johnny had taken this very much
as a joke. What possible connection could there
be between circus and Secret Service? Finding
the problem impossible of solution, he turned
his attention to his own plight. He had started
upon a strange journey of which he knew not
even the destination. In his pocket was a five-dollar
bill and some loose change. He must
stick to this circus until he had regained a certain
precious bit of jewelry. How was he to do
that? One of the three lady circus performers
had it, he felt sure, but how was he to find out
which one? Should he be so fortunate as to discover
this, how was he to regain possession
of it?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Hedged about as the life of the circus woman
is, by those of her own kind, the task seemed
impossible, yet somehow it must be done. It had
been the utmost folly for Marjory to wear her
mother&rsquo;s engagement ring, set with an immense
solitaire, dangling on a chain, when they attended
the circus, yet she had done it, and
Johnny had promised to watch it. He had kept
a sharp lookout, but had been caught unawares
when the thief had proved to be an elephant,
who doubtless had taken it for something to eat,
and, having scratched his trunk upon it, had
tossed it to his lady friends of the human species,
to see what they thought of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rotten luck!&rdquo; Johnny grumbled, as he
turned over once more to fall asleep.</p>
<p>By a succession of sudden stops and starts,
by the bumping of cars, and the grinding of
brakes, Johnny realized that at last they had
come to a stopping place. When the starting
and stopping had continued for some time, he
knew the city they were entering was a large
one. Opening his eyes sleepily, he propped himself
up on one elbow and tried to peer about
him. It was still dark. A stone wall rose a
short distance above the cars on either side.
Above and beyond the wall to the left great
buildings loomed. From one of these, towering
far above the rest, lights gleamed here and there.
The others were totally dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big one&rsquo;s a hotel, rest office buildings,&rdquo; was
Johnny&rsquo;s mental comment. &ldquo;But say, where
have I seen this before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lifting himself to his knees, he looked down
the track in the direction they had just come.
A tower pointing skyward appeared to have
closed in on their wake. Turning, he looked in
the opposite direction. A dull gray bulk loomed
out of the dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Chicago,&rdquo; he muttered in surprise. &ldquo;Of all
places! We&rsquo;ve come all the way from that jerk-water
city of Amaraza to put on a show in good
old Chi. Can&rsquo;t be a bit of doubt of it, for yonder&rsquo;s
the Auditorium hotel, back there&rsquo;s the Illinois
Central depot, and ahead the Art Institute.
Grant Park&rsquo;s our destination. The situation
improves. We&rsquo;ll have some real excitement.
Pant will be tickled pink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pant! Oh, Pant!&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely.
&ldquo;Pant!&rdquo; He spoke the name aloud.</p>
<p>Receiving no answer, he climbed over the canvas
piles to the spot where Pant had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d
shake me like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dropped into gloomy reflections. What
was his next move? He had counted on Pant&rsquo;s
assistance. Now he must go it alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he sighed at last, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just hang
around and let things happen. They generally
do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Before darkness came again things had happened&mdash;several
things, in which the fortunes of
Johnny Thompson rose and fell to rise again
like bits of cork on a storm-tossed sea.</p>
<p>Before putting his hand on the iron rod to
lower himself to the cinder strewn track, he
gave himself over to a moment of recollection.
He was thinking of this strange fellow, Pant.
Again he groped his way in the dark cave in
Siberia, with Pant&rsquo;s all-seeing eye to guide him.
Again he fought the Japs in Vladivostok.
Again&mdash;but I will not recount all his vivid recollections
here, for you have doubtless read them
in the book called &ldquo;Panther Eye.&rdquo; It is enough
to say that the incidents of this story proved
beyond a doubt that Pant could see in the dark,
but as to how and why he was so strangely
gifted, that had remained a mystery to the end;
and to Johnny Thompson it was to this time as
great a mystery as in the beginning.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>Pant had left the circus train at Twenty-second
Street. He had drawn his cap down to
his dark goggles, and hurrying over to State
Street, boarded a north-bound surface car.</p>
<p>A half hour later he climbed the last of six
flights of stairs, and turning a key in a dusty
door, let himself into a room that overlooked
the river at Wells Street.</p>
<p>This room had been Johnny Thompson&rsquo;s retreat
in those stirring days told of in &ldquo;Triple
Spies.&rdquo; Johnny had turned the key over to Pant
before he left Russia. Pant had renewed the
lease, and had, from time to time, as his
strangely mysterious travels led through Chicago,
climbed the stairs to sit by the window
and reflect, or to throw himself upon the bed
and give himself over to many hours of sleep.</p>
<p>At present he was not in need of sleep.
Swinging the blinds back without the slightest
sound, he drew a chair to the window and, dropping
his chin in his cupped hands, fell into deep
reflection. His inscrutable, mask-like face
seemed a blank. Only twice during two hours
did the muscles relax. Each time it was into a
cat-like smile. Just before these moments of
amusement there had appeared upon the river,
far below, a broad patch of crimson light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Morning before the circus performance is like
the wash of a receding tide. Dull gray fog still
lingers in the air. In front of the ropes that
exclude visitors a few curiosity seekers wander
up and down, but it is behind these lines, on
behind the kitchen, mess, and horse tents that
the real denizens of the fog are to be found.
Here a host of attaches of the circus, and those
not definitely attached, wander about like beasts
in their cages, or engage in occupations of
doubtful character. Here are to be found in
great numbers the colored razor-backs, mingled
with the white men of that profession. Stake
drivers, rope pullers, venders of peanuts and
pop, mingle with the motley crowd of sharp-witted
gentry who, like vultures following a
victorious army, live in the wake of a prosperous
circus. Later, all these would sleep, but for
the moment, like owls and bats, they cling to the
last bit of morning fog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>It was down this much trodden &ldquo;gold coast&rdquo;
at the back door of the circus that Johnny
Thompson found himself walking. He had
taken his coffee and fried eggs at a restaurant
that backed &ldquo;Boul Mich.&rdquo; He was now in search
of Pant, also hoping for things to turn up,
which, presently, they did.</p>
<p>So Johnny sauntered slowly along the broad
walk bordering the Lake Front park.</p>
<p>Here and there he paused to study the faces
of men who sat munching their breakfast.
Faces always interested him, and besides, he
knew full well that some of the sharpest as well
as the lowest criminals follow a circus.</p>
<p>His course was soon arrested by the hoarse
half whisper of a man to the right of him.
About this man&mdash;a white man&mdash;was gathered
a knot of other men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five, if you pick the black card. Try your
luck! Try it, brother. Five dollars, if you pick
the lucky card.&rdquo; These were the words the man
whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>Johnny edged his way to the center of the
group. In shady places at the back of great
country picnics, or in secluded sheds at county
fairs, he had seen this game played many a time,
but to find it in a Chicago park seemed unbelievable.
Yet, here it was. A broad shouldered
man, with an irregular mouth and a ragged ear,
evidently badly mauled in some fight, stood with
a newspaper held flat before him. On the
paper, face down, were three ordinary playing
cards. The slim, tapering fingers of the man
played over the cards, as a pianist&rsquo;s fingers play
over the keys. Now he gathered them all up to
toss them one by one, face up, on the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, gents; two reds and a black! Watch it!
There it is! There it is! Now, there! Five
dollars, if you pick the lucky card! Five to me
if you lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shot an inquiring glance toward Johnny.
Johnny remained silent.</p>
<p>A short, stout man thrust a five dollar bill
into the conman&rsquo;s hand. His trembling fingers
turned a card. It was red. With an oath he
struggled out of the ring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t hit it always, brother,&rdquo; a smirky smile
overspread the conman&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, I&rsquo;ll make it easy. There it is!
Leave it there. Who will try? Who will try?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A young man wearing a green tie passed over
a ten dollar bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it all or nothing. All or nothing,&rdquo;
chuckled the operator.</p>
<p>The youth grinned. His confident finger
picked the card. It was black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You win, brother, you win. I told you.
Now, who&rsquo;ll win next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he shot a glance at Johnny. Again
Johnny was silent.</p>
<p>Twice more the game was played. Each
time the conman lost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody wins this morning.&rdquo; The conman&rsquo;s
fingers played with the cards, and in
playing bent the corner of the black card ever
so slightly upward. Johnny&rsquo;s keen eyes saw it.
When the card was turned, he had picked it
right. Five times in imaginary plays the conman
tossed the cards down and gathered them
up. Each time Johnny&rsquo;s eye, following the bent
card, told him he was right. Six times he picked
the black card correctly. Was the conman
drunk? He thought not. His keen eyes studied
the circle of faces. Then he laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you think it is?&rdquo; The conman
bantered.</p>
<p>Johnny pointed a finger at the bent card.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you bet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny laughed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bate.&rdquo; A Swede standing near Johnny
thrust out a five dollar bill.</p>
<p>He won.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See?&rdquo; jeered the conman. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re no
sport. You&rsquo;re a coward.&rdquo; He leered at Johnny.</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s cheek turned a shade redder, but he
only smiled.</p>
<p>Again the Swede bet and won.</p>
<p>Again the conman had the word &ldquo;coward&rdquo;
on his lips. He did not say it.</p>
<p>Johnny was speaking. There was a cold smile
on his lips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you one thing, stranger,&rdquo; Johnny
squared his shoulders, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in the habit of
allowing men to call me a coward. I&rsquo;ll tell you
why I don&rsquo;t play your rotten game, then I&rsquo;ll tell
you something else. That man, and that one,
and that one and this Swede are your cappers.
You had twenty-five dollars between you when
I came. You got five from that stranger who
left. When one of your cappers won, he passed
the money from hand to hand until it came back
to you. If they lost it&rsquo;s the same. A stranger
has about as much chance with a bunch like you
as a day-old chick has in the middle of the
Atlantic. But say, stranger, you called me a
coward. I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do. You&rsquo;ve got
me topped by seventy-five pounds, and you think
you know how to handle your dukes. I&rsquo;ll box
you three rounds, and if you touch my face in
any round, I&rsquo;ll give you a five-case note, the last
one I have. Not bet, see! Just give! You can&rsquo;t
lose; you may win. What say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conman&rsquo;s lips parted, but no sound came.
The eyes of his pals and cappers were upon
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t let the little runt bluff y&rsquo;,&rdquo;
suggested the young capper of the green tie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;all, all right, brother.&rdquo; The conman&rsquo;s
voice stuck in his throat. &ldquo;All right. Somebody
fetch the gloves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A boxing match, or even a free-for-all, is not
so uncommon on the back lines of a circus, but
it never fails to draw a crowd. It was upon
this inevitable crowd that Johnny counted for
his backing, should the three rounds turn into a
rough and tumble, with no mercy and no
quarter.</p>
<p>Once his gloves were on, he explained to the
rapidly growing circle the terms of the match.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no referee, so all of you are it,&rdquo; he
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right-O. We&rsquo;re wid ye,&rdquo; a genial Irishman
shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to it, kid,&rdquo; a sturdy stake driver echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>Johnny moved his gloves to a position not ten
inches from his body. With fists well extended,
the conman leaped across the ring. The blow
he aimed at Johnny&rsquo;s head would have felled an
ox, had it landed. It did not land. Johnny had
sprung to one side. The next instant he tapped
the conman on his ragged ear.</p>
<p>This appeared to infuriate his antagonist.
Perhaps it served to bring back memories of another
battle in which he had been worsted. His
rage did him neither service nor credit. Time
and again he bounded at the elusive Johnny, to
find himself fanning air. Time and again
Johnny tapped that ragged ear. The conman
landed not a single blow. When, after three
minutes, a man called time, and the two paused
to take a breath, the plaudits were all for
Johnny.</p>
<p>As he rested, the beady eyes of the conman
narrowed to slits. He was thinking, planning.
He had not scored on the first bout, the second
would see him a winner.</p>
<p>Instantly upon re-entering the ring he rushed
Johnny for a clinch. Taken by surprise, the boy
could not avoid it. Yet, even here, he was more
than a match for his heavier opponent. Gripping
hard with his left, he rained blows on the
other&rsquo;s back, just above the kidney. That, in
time, made a break welcome.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>The conman&rsquo;s game was to clinch, then to
force his opponent back to a position where he
could land his right on Johnny&rsquo;s chin. This
would win his point. More than that, it would
enable him to break Johnny&rsquo;s neck, if he chose,
and he might so decide.</p>
<p>Three times he clinched. Three times he received
trip-hammer blows on his back, and three
times he gave way before his plucky opponent.
When, at last, time was called, he fairly reeled
to his corner.</p>
<p>There was a dangerous light in his eye as he
stepped up for the third round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch him, kid. He&rsquo;ll do you dirt,&rdquo; muttered
the Irishman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your guard,&rdquo; echoed another.</p>
<p>Johnny, still smiling, moved forward. His
face was well guarded. He was confident of
victory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>Twice the conman feinted with his right,
struck out with his left, then retired. The third
time he rushed straight on. Johnny easily
dodged his blows, but the next second doubled
up in a knot. Groaning and panting for breath
he fell to the earth.</p>
<p>Eagerly the conman leaped forward. His
glove had barely touched Johnny&rsquo;s cheek when
a grip of iron pulled him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no referee. Then I&rsquo;m one. An
Irishman for a square scrap.&rdquo; It was Johnny&rsquo;s
ardent backer.</p>
<p>Panting, the conman stood at bay.</p>
<p>In time, Johnny, having regained his breath,
sat up dizzily and looked about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the five?&rdquo; demanded the conman.</p>
<p>Johnny held up his right glove. &ldquo;I leave it
to the crowd if he gets it fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He fouled you wid his knee! He jammed it
into yer stummick! A rotten trick as ever was
played!&rdquo; yelled the Irishman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right-O! Sure! Sure! Kill him! Eat him
alive!&rdquo; came from every corner.</p>
<p>Johnny rose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll finish the round,&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your money,&rdquo; grumbled the conman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! No!&rdquo; came from a hundred
throats, for by this time a dense mob was packed
about the improvised ring. Chairs, benches and
barrels had been dragged up. On these men
stood looking over the shoulders of those in
front.</p>
<p>Like an enraged bull the conman stood at bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he laughed savagely. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll finish
it quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaped squarely at Johnny. Johnny&rsquo;s
whole body seemed to stiffen, then to rise.
Springing full ten inches from the ground and
ten inches forward, he shot out his glove. There
came the thudding impact of a master-blow.</p>
<p>The conman rose slightly in the air, then
reeled backward into the mob. The point of his
chin had come in contact with Johnny&rsquo;s fist.</p>
<p>With characteristic speed, Johnny threw off
the gloves, seized his coat and lost himself in the
crowd.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>He was not ashamed of his part in the affair,
far from that. He knew he had given the crook
only that which he richly deserved. He was not,
however, at that moment looking for publicity,
and escape was the only way to avoid it.</p>
<p>In eluding the crowd he was singularly successful.
By dodging about the horse tent, and
rounding the mess tent, he was able to make his
way directly to the shore of the lake. Here he
walked rapidly south until he found himself
alone. Throwing himself upon the ground, for
ten minutes he watched the small breakers coil
and recoil upon the shore. Rising, he lifted his
laughing blue eyes to the sunshine. Then, scooping
up hands-full of the clear lake water, he
bathed his face, his chest, his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy! Boy!&rdquo; he breathed, as he beat his
chest dry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sure good to be alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later his face clouded. &ldquo;But how
about that diamond ring? Oh, you sparkler,
come to your daddy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this, he repaired to the show site.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>On returning to the rear of the circus tents,
he was surprised to be accosted at once by a
smooth-shaven, sturdy man with a clean, clear
look in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the boy that&rsquo;s so handy with his
mitts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny had a mind to run for it, but one look
into those clear eyes told him this would be
folly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they say,&rdquo; he smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shake! I like you for that.&rdquo; The stranger
extended his hand.</p>
<p>Johnny gripped it warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way you handled that conman wasn&rsquo;t
bad; not half-bad. You&rsquo;re a sport; a regular
one! The circus boys like a good sport; the real
chaps do. How&rsquo;d you like a job?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a job?&rdquo; Johnny stammered. &ldquo;What
kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Circus job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind?&rdquo; Johnny repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; suddenly Johnny had an inspiration.
&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m the best little groom there is
in three states. I could shine up those fat bareback
horses of yours till you&rsquo;d take them for
real plate glass.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Could you? I believe you could, and you&rsquo;re
going to have a chance. Millie Gonzales&rsquo; three
mounts have been neglected of late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Millie Gonzales! Johnny caught his breath.
He had gone fishing and caught a whale the
first cast. Millie Gonzales was one of the three
circus girls at whose feet the diamond ring
had dropped. Perhaps she was the one who had
picked it up; who held it among her possessions
now. He would know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When can I go to work?&rdquo; he asked unsteadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right now. I&rsquo;ll take you over to the stables.
Stable boss&rsquo;ll give you a suit and some
unionalls. You shape up the three and have &rsquo;em
ready for Millie by two o&rsquo;clock, in time for the
grand parade.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the luck!&rdquo; Johnny whispered into the
ear of a sleek, broad backed gray a half hour
later. &ldquo;To think that I should have fallen into
this at the very start! Perhaps Millie has it.
Perhaps she&rsquo;s wearing it on one of those tapering
fingers of hers at this very moment. Is she,
old boy? Is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horse looked at him with eyes that said
nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; Johnny bantered. &ldquo;Well,
then, I&rsquo;ll have to find out for myself. Come on,
you two o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br />CHAPTER III
<br />THE FEASTERS SEE A HAUNT</h2>
<p>Pant did not return to the neighborhood of
the circus grounds until darkness had fallen.
Then it was only to go skulking along the beach,
and to perch himself at last, owl-like, on a huge
pile of sand which overlooked a particular
stretch of the beach on which a huge fire of
driftwood had been built. The fire had died
down now to a great, glowing bed of coals.
About the fire eight negroes were seated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Razor-backs from the circus,&rdquo; was Pant&rsquo;s
mental comment. &ldquo;Something doing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So filled with their own thoughts were the
minds of the colored gentlemen that they had
failed to note Pant&rsquo;s arrival. Seated there in
the darkness, motionless as an owl watching for
the move of a mouse, his mask-like face expressionless,
his slim, tapering fingers still, Pant appeared
but a part of the dull drab scenery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Brother Mose; time to carb de turkey-buzzard,&rdquo;
chuckled one of the darkies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Mose&rdquo; turned half about, stretched
out a fat hand and drew toward him a thin
object wrapped in a newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sambo,&rdquo; he commanded, &ldquo;leave me have dat
cleavah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sambo handed over a butcher&rsquo;s cleaver.</p>
<p>The next instant the package was unwrapped,
revealing a clean, white strip of meat, which had
at one time been half the broad back of a porker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Po&rsquo;k chops!&rdquo; murmured Mose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um! Um! Um!&rdquo; came in a chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya-as, sir. Now you-all jes&rsquo; stir up dem
coals, an&rsquo; put dem sweet &rsquo;taters roastin&rsquo;, while I
does the slicin&rsquo; an&rsquo; de cleavin&rsquo;.&rdquo; Mose drew a
butcher knife from his hip pocket.</p>
<p>From a second bulging package on the beach,
two of his comrades drew shining yellow tubers,
while others stirred up the coals, and raked some
out to a circular hole in the sand, which had
previously been lined with ashes. Having tossed
the coals in, they covered them lightly with
ashes, at the same time calling:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Le&rsquo;s hab dem &rsquo;taters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this time with no observer save the unsuspected
Pant, Mose was operating skillfully on
that pork loin. With a slab of drift wood as
chopping block, he sliced away with the skill of
a hotel butcher. In a twinkle, the chops lay
neatly piled in heaps on the slab. Then, while
no one was looking, he caused a liberal handful
of the chops to disappear into the huge pocket
at the back of his coat.</p>
<p>Pant&rsquo;s lips curved in a smile. &ldquo;Holding out,&rdquo;
he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dere dey is,&rdquo; exulted Mose, like a rooster
calling his brood to a meal. &ldquo;Dere dem po&rsquo;k
chops is, all carved an&rsquo; cleaned an&rsquo; ready fo&rsquo; de
roastin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, um, um,&rdquo; chanted his companions in
gurgling approval.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>Whence had come these pork chops? This
question did not trouble Pant. They might have
been bought at a butcher shop; then again, they
might have been stolen. It was enough for Pant
that they were there. He was glad. Not that
he hoped to &ldquo;horn in&rdquo; on the feast; he had
eaten bountifully but an hour before. Nevertheless,
he was glad to be here. This little festal
occasion suited his purpose beautifully. He had
hoped something like this might be going on
down here. The pork chops stowed away in
Mose&rsquo;s pocket amused him. As he thought of
them his former plan changed slightly, his lips
twisted in a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all plain enough,&rdquo; he thought to himself.
&ldquo;Moses and old Lankyshanks, his buddie, have a
half hour longer to loaf than the rest of them;
that gives them time for a little extra feast.
The supplies belong to them all alike, but Mose
and Lankyshanks get double portions if&mdash;&rdquo;
Here he smiled again.</p>
<p>The preparation for the feast went on. Each
man twisted out of tangled wire a rude but serviceable
broiler. They joked and laughed as they
worked, their dark faces shining like ebony.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Po&rsquo;k chops, po&rsquo;k chops, po&rsquo;k chops! Um!
Um! Um!&rdquo; they chanted now and then.</p>
<p>In time word was passed around the circle,
and then eight right hands shot out and eight
broilers hung out over the coals.</p>
<p>Snapping and sputtering, flaring up with a
sudden burning of grease, whirled now this way,
now that, the pork chops rapidly turned a delicious
brown. The odor which rose in air would
have made a chronic dyspeptic&rsquo;s mouth water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Po&rsquo;k chops, po&rsquo;k chops, po&rsquo;k chops! Um!
Um! Um!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twice Pant lifted his eyes toward the stars.
Twice he brought them down again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t got the heart to do it,&rdquo; he whispered
to himself; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a chance and wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sweet potatoes had been dug from the
roasting pit; the feasters had sunk their teeth
deep in juicy fat, when Pant was suddenly
startled by a groan close at hand.</p>
<p>Without moving, he turned his head to see a
colored boy sitting near him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>Recognizing the round, close-cropped bullet
head as one belonging not to the circus, but to
South Water Street, he leaned over and whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Lo, Snowball, what y&rsquo; doin&rsquo; here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same&rsquo;s you, I reckon.&rdquo; The boy showed all
his teeth in a grin. &ldquo;Jes&rsquo; sittin&rsquo; an&rsquo; a-wishin&rsquo;,
dat&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pork chops, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it so, Mister? Ain&rsquo;t dem the grandes&rsquo;
you ain&rsquo;t most never smelt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh, not so loud,&rdquo; cautioned Pant. &ldquo;Maybe
there&rsquo;ll be some for you yet. Sort of reserve
rations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think so, mebby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant nodded.</p>
<p>Then together they sat in silence while the
feast went on; sat till the last bone and potato
skin had been thrown upon the fast dulling coals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; sighed Snowball. &ldquo;Hain&rsquo;t no mo&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He half rose to go, but Pant pulled him back
to his seat. Six of the colored gentlemen were
wiping their hands on greasy bandanas, and
were preparing to depart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon me and Lanky&rsquo;ll jes&rsquo; res&rsquo; here for a
while,&rdquo; grunted Mose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh-heh,&rdquo; assented Lankyshanks.</p>
<p>The six had hardly disappeared over the hill
when Lankyshanks&rsquo; eyes popped wide open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Mergency rations,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>With a grunt of satisfaction, Mose handed
three pork chops to Lankyshanks, wired his own
three to his broiler, stirred up the fire, then
began slowly revolving the sputtering chops over
the sparkling embers.</p>
<p>For fully five minutes Pant and Snowball, on
the sand pile, watched in silence&mdash;a silence
broken only by an occasional, half audible sigh
from Snowball.</p>
<p>The chops were done to a brown finish when
Pant suddenly fixed his gaze intently upon the
big dipper which hung high in the heavens.</p>
<p>At that precise instant, Mose, uttering a
groan not unlike that of a dying man, threw his
broiler high in air, rolled over backward, turned
two somersaults, then stumbling to his feet, ran
wildly down the beach. Having dropped his
chops on the coals, Lanky followed close behind.
The expression of utter terror written on their
faces was something to see and marvel at.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>Pant still gazed skyward. Snowball gripped
his arm, and whispered tensely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lawdy, Mister! Look&rsquo;a dere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant removed his gaze from the heavens and
looked where Snowball pointed, at the bed of
dying embers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it, Snowball?&rdquo; he drawled.
&ldquo;Why! Where are our friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dey done lef&rsquo;,&rdquo; whispered Snowball, still
gripping his arm. &ldquo;An&rsquo; so &rsquo;ud you. It&rsquo;s a
ha&rsquo;nt, er a sign, er sumthin&rsquo;. Blood. It was
red, lak blood. All red. Dem fellers was red,
an&rsquo; dem po&rsquo;k chops, an&rsquo; dat sand, all red lak
blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pork chops,&rdquo; said Pant slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, po&rsquo;k chops an&rsquo; everything. I done
heard dat Mose say it were a sign. Dey&rsquo;s be a
circus wreck, er sumthin&rsquo;. Train wreck of dat
dere circus.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pork chops,&rdquo; said Pant again thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Where did the pork chops go? Why! There
is one broiler full on the wood pile. They must
have left it there for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir! Dat Mose done throwed it dere.
Dat&rsquo;s how scared he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t be back, I guess; so you&rsquo;d better
just warm them up a bit and sit up to the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terror still lurked in Snowball&rsquo;s eyes, but in
his nostrils still lingered the savory smell of pork
chops. The pork chops won out and he was
soon feasting royally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snowball,&rdquo; said Pant when the feast was
finished, &ldquo;would you like to earn a little
money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would I? Jes&rsquo; try me, Mister!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. I want five Liberty Bonds, the
fifty-dollar kind. A lot of those circus fellows
have them, and some of them will sell them, maybe
cheap. Don&rsquo;t pay more than forty-five for any.
Get them for thirty-nine, if you can. The cheap
ones are the kind I want. Here&rsquo;s the money.
Don&rsquo;t bet it, don&rsquo;t lose it, and don&rsquo;t let any of
those crooks touch you for it. It will take you
a little time to find the bonds. I&rsquo;ll meet you
right here in two hours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>Snowball rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Boss, I sho&rsquo; am
grateful fo&rsquo; th&rsquo; compliment, but I is plum scared
at all dat money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;ll hurt you or take it from you.
You&rsquo;re honest. If you do lose it, I&rsquo;ll forgive
you. Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant strode rapidly down the beach, leaving
Snowball to make his way back to the circus
grounds in quest of thirty-nine dollar Liberty
Bonds, an article which, if he had but known
it, has never existed in legitimate channels of
business.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br />CHAPTER IV
<br />&ldquo;PALE FACE BONDS&rdquo;</h2>
<p>After leaving Pant, Snowball divided the
money he had been given for the purpose of
purchasing Liberty Bonds into five little rolls.
These he deposited in five different pockets
about his ragged trousers and coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dere now,&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;dey won&rsquo;t nobody
snatch it all from me at oncet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He first wandered down the back ropes, accosting
here and there a colored gentleman who
looked as if he might be the proud possessor
of a bond.</p>
<p>Some laughed at this bullet-headed youngster,
who claimed to be in possession of enough
money to purchase a &ldquo;sho&rsquo; nuff&rdquo; Liberty Bond.
Others, with prying eyes, leered at his pockets.
These he gave a wide berth. An hour of this
sort of thing netted him two bonds at forty-two
dollars each.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; he grunted at last, &ldquo;these here colored
circus folks sho&rsquo; am plum short on Liberty
Bonds. Reckon I&rsquo;se gwine try some white
mans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Making his way boldly out to the front of the
circus, where a thin crowd filtered in and out,
here and there, some few drifting into the side
shows, he made straight for a man in uniform
who guarded the entrance to the big tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Mister, you all got any Liberty Bonds
to sell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liberty Bonds?&rdquo; The man started and
stared. &ldquo;Who wants &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me. I do, Mister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; The man bent low and whispered.
&ldquo;You see that man selling tickets in front of the
big side show, by the picture of the fat lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh-huh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got some. Bought them this morning,
cheap. Mebbe he&rsquo;ll sell them to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank ye, Mister.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>Snowball was away like a flash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liberty Bonds?&rdquo; said the ticket hawker of
the black mustache. &ldquo;How many?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might buy one, if it&rsquo;s cheap, mebbe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How cheap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much you all want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snowball shook his head, &ldquo;Thirty-nine.
That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m payin&rsquo; jes&rsquo; now.&rdquo; His hand was
in his right trousers pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see yer money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snowball stepped back a discreet distance,
then displayed two twenty-dollar bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, let&rsquo;s have &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see dat Liberty Bond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; The man dug into his inner vest
pocket, produced a flat envelope from which he
extracted a square of paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snowball inspected it closely. &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s all
right, Mister. I git a dollar back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ticket seller peeled a one-dollar bill from
a bulky roll and the deal was closed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Mister,&rdquo; said Snowball, rolling his eyes,
&ldquo;I might buy another one, same price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you say so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snowball grinned.</p>
<p>Again the deal was closed.</p>
<p>Snowball put his hand into his left hip pocket
and repeated his declaration:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Mister, I might buy jes&rsquo; one more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a second time the man&rsquo;s eyes rested on
him with suspicion lurking in their depths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, boy, who you buying these for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fo&rsquo; me, mysef.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Mr. First National Bank, here you
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deal was quickly closed and Snowball
hastened away, happy in the realization that he
had accomplished the task set for him.</p>
<p>Making his way to the beach, he found Pant
sprawled out on the sand, half asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get them?&rdquo; the white man asked
drowsily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya-as, sir. Here dey is.&rdquo; Snowball held
out the five bonds. &ldquo;An&rsquo; here&rsquo;s de change.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>Pant sat up, suddenly all alert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got three for thirty-nine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya-as, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant&rsquo;s slender fingers trembled as he spread
the five squares of paper out upon the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;You got them all
right. Now look at them all. Snowball. See
any difference in &rsquo;em?&rdquo; He held a lighted match
above the bonds.</p>
<p>Snowball studied them as intently as his roving
eyes would allow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, sir, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These two. Look different, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, sir; I can&rsquo;t say dat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re blind,&rdquo; grunted Pant. &ldquo;Two of them
are paler than the others; ink is not so dark.
See? Not quite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yas, ya-as, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now those two pale face bonds were folded
up with one other. Remember where you got
them?&rdquo; Pant&rsquo;s eyes flashed through his thick
glasses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Oh, ya-as, ya-as, sir, I do. It were
dat &rsquo;ere white man; sellin&rsquo; tickets, he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! Now here&rsquo;s a dollar. That&rsquo;s for you.
You&rsquo;ll get another when you come back. You
take these two pale face bonds to the ticket seller
and ask him where he got them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya-as, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Full of wonder at the strange doings of this
odd fellow with the black glasses, Snowball hurried
back to the ticket seller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Mister,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;whar&rsquo;d y&rsquo; git
these pale face bonds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; The man stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whar y&rsquo; git &rsquo;em?&rdquo; Snowball held them up
for inspection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see.&rdquo; The man made a grab for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nem&rsquo; min&rsquo;.&rdquo; The boy darted away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wants to know?&rdquo; the man demanded
gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell exactly. I bought two from Tom
Stick, the midget clown, three from Andy
McQueen, the steam kettle cook, and two more
from a bunco-steerer&mdash;feller with a bite taken
out of his ear. I don&rsquo;t know which ones those
are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, boy!&rdquo; The expression on his face suddenly
changed. &ldquo;You let me have them bonds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snowball dashed away in sudden fright. With
the ticket seller close on his heels, he dodged
around a fat woman, nearly collided with a
baby carriage, leaped the tent ropes. Like a
jack rabbit, he scooted beneath the ponderous
wagons on which rested the electric light plant
of the circus, and, at last, dodging through the
mess tent, succeeded in eluding his pursuer.</p>
<p>He was still breathing hard when he reached
the place of rendezvous on the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; demanded Pant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he bought some from dat midget
clown, an&rsquo; some from a steam kettle cook, an&rsquo;
some from a bunco-man wid a chewed ear. Say,
Mister, do I get dat oder dollar?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>Pant held it out to him. &ldquo;What you puffing
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat ticket man chased me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know, boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment they were silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Boss,&rdquo; Snowball whispered after a
time, &ldquo;what you s&rsquo;pose made dat ere red splotch
on the groun&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What red spot?&rdquo; There was a suspicion of
a smile lurking about the corner of Pant&rsquo;s
mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man! Don&rsquo; you know? &rsquo;Roun&rsquo; dat fiah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; I wasn&rsquo;t looking just then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Boss!&rdquo; The boy was whispering again.
&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t afraid of almost nuthin&rsquo;&mdash;nuthin&rsquo; but
signs and ghosts. You s&rsquo;pose dat were a sign?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; say, Boss, what&rsquo;s dem colored fellers
sayin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout a wreck? Don&rsquo; mean that ere circus
train&rsquo;s gwine wreck? Man, that&rsquo;d be some
kind of a wreck! Tigers fightin&rsquo; b&rsquo;ars, lions
eatin&rsquo; elephants, snakes a-crawlin&rsquo; loose, wild
cats a-clawin&rsquo;, an monkeys screamin&rsquo;! Man!
Oh, man!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>For a full minute Snowball sat silent, wild-eyed
and staring at the mental picture he had
conjured up. Then a sudden thought struck
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Boss, dis am circus day ain&rsquo;t it? An&rsquo;
I got two dollars I jes&rsquo; earned and ain&rsquo;t spent,
ain&rsquo;t I? Boss, I&rsquo;se gone right now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he was.</p>
<p>For a long time Pant sat there in contemplative
silence. Finally, with one hand he smoothed
out the sand before him. On this, with his
finger, he spelled out the name: BLACKIE
McCREE.</p>
<p>Then, with a quick glance about him, as if
afraid it had been seen, he erased the letters.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>When Johnny Thompson had been introduced
to the stable boss and had been given his assignment,
he lost no time in getting on a suit of
unionalls and was soon at work sleeking down
his three broad backed dapple grays.</p>
<p>It was a long task, painstakingly done, for
Johnny loved horses and these three were
among the finest in the circus.</p>
<p>His mind, however, was not always on his
brush and cloth. In the grand parade, which,
in Chicago did not leave the tent, but circled
about in the mammoth enclosure, while the vast
crowds cheered, Millie Gonzales rode standing
on these three fat chargers, that, with tossing
manes and champing bits, seemed at every
moment ready to break her control and go rushing
down the arena. Johnny was to take the
horses to the entrance of the big tent. That
much he had been told. Would he there turn
them over to Millie? And would she be wearing
the missing ring? The answers to these
questions he could only guess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>It was with a wildly beating heart that he at
last led his three horses down the narrow canvas
enclosure which led to the great tent. Already
the procession was forming. Here a group of
clowns waited in silence. Here a great gilded
chariot rumbled forward, and here a trained
elephant was being fitted with his rider&rsquo;s canopied
seat.</p>
<p>By this director, then that one, Johnny was
guided to the spot from which his three dapple
grays would start.</p>
<p>He had hardly reached the position than a
high-pitched, melodious, but slightly scornful,
voice said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! Who are you? Where&rsquo;s Peter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Peter?&rdquo; asked Johnny, doffing his
cap respectfully, but studying the girl&rsquo;s hands
the meanwhile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s my groom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begging your pardon, he&rsquo;s not; I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; She stood back and surveyed him
with unveiled scorn. &ldquo;You? A little shrimp
like you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny was angry. Hot words rushed to his
lips but remained unspoken. He was playing
a big game. For the time he must repress his
pride.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; Millie stormed on, &ldquo;I like a big
groom, a strong one. I shall see about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; smiled Johnny, &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s strength you
want, I guess you&rsquo;ll find me there. And for
horses, I know how to groom them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Millie cast an appraising eye over the grays.
&ldquo;Did you do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lifting a dainty foot, she waited for Johnny&rsquo;s
palm. Once it rested securely there, she gave a
little spring and would have landed neatly on
the first gray&rsquo;s back, had not Johnny suddenly
shot his arm upward. As it was, she rose
straight in the air three feet above the horses
to land squarely on the middle one of the three.</p>
<p>She landed fairly on her feet. A whip sang
through the air. She had aimed a vicious blow
at Johnny&rsquo;s cheek. There was a wild flare of
anger in her eye.</p>
<p>Dodging out of her reach, Johnny stood
trembling for fear he had foolishly wasted his
grand chance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>Presently the girl&rsquo;s lips curved in a half disdainful
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an impudent fellow, and I should
have some one thrash you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are strong, though,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;and
because of that, I&rsquo;ll forgive you. In the future,
however, remember that I am Millie Gonzales
and you are my groom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny nodded gravely. The procession
moved forward. Millie passed from his view.</p>
<p>After calmly reviewing the situation, one fact
stood out in bold relief in Johnny&rsquo;s mind: If it
were Millie Gonzales who had the ring, his task
was to be a difficult one, for she was a keen,
crafty, high-tempered, unscrupulous Spaniard,
who would stop at nothing to gain her end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway,&rdquo; he decided, &ldquo;if she has it,
she is not wearing it. It&rsquo;s not on her hand.
Here&rsquo;s hoping it&rsquo;s one of the other two.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>He moved to a position where he could watch
the parade. For a full three minutes his eyes
swept it from end to end. Out of it all&mdash;the
troop of elephants, the brass band, the clowns,
the performers, the many strange carts and
chariots&mdash;one figure stood supreme: A girl
who rode high on a throne, mounted upon a
great chariot, escorted by six footmen, and
drawn by six prancing chargers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The queen of the circus!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I
wonder who she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny had hardly spoken the words when,
for a second, the girl&rsquo;s smiling face was turned
his way. He caught his breath sharply. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
one of the three,&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;If it is she who
has the ring&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not finish, for just then the van of the
procession entered the wing, and he slipped
away behind the canvas to await Millie Gonzales
and the three grays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say pard,&rdquo; he whispered to a circus hand
standing beside him, &ldquo;who&rsquo;s this queen of the
circus?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; the other asked in surprise.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Gwen Maysfield, the tight-rope
dancer. A regular sport she is, too; can box
like a man. Packs a wallop, too. I&rsquo;ve seen her
knock this fellow who boxes the bear clean over
the ropes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boxes the bear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Don&rsquo;t you know the act? Feller&rsquo;s
got a bear; rides bicycles, and all that. One of
his stunts is to put on the gloves with the big
silver-gray. Of course it&rsquo;s a frost. Bear could
knock him a mile, if he wanted to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny said no more, but soon began piecing
together his bits of information. Gwen was the
queen of the circus. She was also one of the
three at whose feet the diamond ring had
dropped. She liked boxing. If only he could
manage to get a few rounds with her, that
might break down the social barrier that stood
between them. Then he could ask her about the
ring. But she was the queen, and he only a
groom. How was he to manage it? She boxed
with the performer who boxed the bear. Perhaps
he could make the acquaintance of this bear
boxer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>The time was approaching when Millie and
her three grays were to go on. He hastened
away to his work.</p>
<p>That night in the animal tent, while the
exhibition was in full swing, while thousands
were crowding before the long line of cages,
there occurred a strange and startling incident;
a cage plainly marked BLACK LEOPARD had
appeared, in the uncertain light of night,
entirely empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s a fake,&rdquo; a spectator grumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked a child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Says &lsquo;Black Pussy,&rsquo;&rdquo; smiled the father,
&ldquo;but I guess there isn&rsquo;t any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Papa, I want to see the black pussy!&rdquo;
wailed the child, clinging to the ropes, and
refusing to move along.</p>
<p>The father was striving to quiet the child
when, of a sudden, a flash of crimson light
brought out the dark corners of the cage in bold
relief. It was gone in a twinkling, but in that
time a raging fury of black fur, flashing claws
and gleaming eyes leaped against the bars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>The child screamed, the father swore softly.
There was a succession of exclamations from
the crowd. A colored attendant, who chanced
to be passing with a bundle of straw, dropped
his burden to stare, open mouthed, at the cage.</p>
<p>When he again put his trembling fingers to
the bundle of straw, it was to mutter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tain&rsquo;t no safe place fer a &rsquo;spectable colored
man to wuck. &rsquo;T&rsquo;ain&rsquo; safe. All dem raid
flashes ever&rsquo;whar. Can&rsquo;t fry po&rsquo;k chops fer &rsquo;em.
Can&rsquo;t wuck, can&rsquo;t do nuttin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night, after the grand performance was
concluded, after the surging crowd had passed
out, after the arc lights had fluttered, blinked,
and then left the place in darkness, Johnny went
out for a breath of fresh air before turning into
the bunk assigned to him. He was walking
around the end of the big top when a sudden
flash of crimson appeared against the canvas.
It was a flash only, remaining not one second,
but Johnny paused to listen.</p>
<p>In another moment there came a whispered,
&ldquo;Hello, Johnny,&rdquo; and Pant appeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You work for this circus?&rdquo; Johnny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. You?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, got a job to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. That puts you inside. You can help
me, Johnny&mdash;help me a lot, and believe me, kid,
it&rsquo;s big&mdash;the biggest thing we ever worked on.&rdquo;
Pant&rsquo;s words came quick and tense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell you now, but you can help. Here,
take these three Liberty Bonds. They&rsquo;re good
ones. You take &rsquo;em over town and sell &rsquo;em.
Here&rsquo;s a hundred iron men. You buy me five
more bonds from these circus men, see? Any
of &rsquo;em. You&rsquo;re inside, see? You can do it.
Buy five. They&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em. They&rsquo;ll sell
&rsquo;em, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call that light business, dealing in Liberty
Bonds on a small margin,&rdquo; grumbled Johnny.
&ldquo;What shall I pay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty-nine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody but a crazy man would sell &rsquo;em
for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe not, Johnny, but they&rsquo;ll sell &rsquo;em. Pay
more, if you have to. The game&rsquo;s a big one, I
tell you. So long.&rdquo; Pant vanished into the
night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />CHAPTER V
<br />STRANGE DOINGS IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>The following day Johnny carried out Pant&rsquo;s
wish in the matter of selling the three Liberty
Bonds. When it came to picking up other bonds
at Pant&rsquo;s excessively low price, he experienced
greater difficulty than had Snowball. Indeed,
in all his time off duty he secured only one bond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I haven&rsquo;t struck the right spot yet,&rdquo;
was his mental comment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try again
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was just as he was about to return to his
dapple grays that he received a sudden shock.
He had been idly glancing over the &ldquo;Daily
News&rdquo; when a headline caught his eye:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Offers $1,000 Reward for Return of Lost
Gem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly he read down the column, then his
face fell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess he thinks I stole it,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>It certainly looked that way, for Major MacDonald
had publicly offered a reward of a
thousand dollars for the return of the ring, and
had made it plain that no questions would be
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t be asked, either.&rdquo; Johnny set
his teeth hard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let him know that he can
keep his reward. I&rsquo;ll get that ring back, and
I&rsquo;ll send it to him with no return address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as he spoke, he started. A new thought
had struck him. What if the girl who had the
ring should read of the reward and return the
jewelry? Where would he be then?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d think I had stolen it and given it to a
circus girl,&rdquo; Johnny groaned. &ldquo;Then what
would he think of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the next moment he was resolute again.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get next to that boxing bear fellow right
away, and I&rsquo;ll cultivate the acquaintance of
Millie, if she cuts my face open with that whip
of hers. I&rsquo;ll win yet! Watch my smoke!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>He hastened away, resolved upon getting
better acquainted with Millie Gonzales at once.</p>
<p>That night, however, offered no further
opportunity for making acquaintances. Indeed,
he was made more and more conscious of the
fact that in the circus there existed an almost
unbreakable line of caste. There were the performers
and the attendants. The attendants
were kept in their places. They did not mingle
with the performers; they were distinctly considered
beneath them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; Johnny said to himself, &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s
that, why I&rsquo;ll have to get to be a performer,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when he came to think it over soberly, he
could imagine no means by which this end could
be attained.</p>
<p>If he had but known it, the opportunity was
to present itself in a not far distant time, and
in a manner as startling as it was sudden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>In one thing that night he was extremely
fortunate&mdash;he succeeded in securing a position
where he could get a clear view of the performance
of two very interesting persons, Gwen, the
Queen, and Allegretti, the man who boxed the
bear. The contrast of the two stood out in his
thoughts long after the performers had moved
out of the ring. Gwen was wonderful. Johnny
was sure he had never seen anyone to equal her
in all his life. Light as a feather, waving her
delicate silk parasol here and there, she tripped
across the invisible wire. Yet, fairy-like as she
was, every move spoke of strength, of well
developed and perfectly trained muscles. She
wore the accustomed grease paint of the ring,
but Johnny did not need to be told that beneath
this there lay the glow of a healthy skin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager
she&rsquo;s an American. Only an American girl
could be like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the quarter of an hour during
which Gwen was the center of attention of the
vast throng, he watched her. The breathless
leaps in air, the light, tripping dance from post
to post, the bow, the smile&mdash;he saw it all and
breathed hard as she at last danced out of
the ring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If she has the ring, it&rsquo;s going to be hard
to get it,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;If another could be
bought, and I had the money, I&rsquo;d rather buy it
and let her keep the old one, but there&rsquo;s only
one in all the world, and if she has it I must
get it from her. Gwen, big, wonderful American
girl, I&rsquo;m for you, but I&rsquo;m also a hard
hearted detective, and I&rsquo;m on your trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The antics of the swarthy foreigner who
boxed the bear were as ludicrous and grotesque
as Gwen&rsquo;s act had been exquisite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clumsy lobster!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed, after
watching him for five minutes. &ldquo;What he
doesn&rsquo;t know about boxing would fill an encyclopedia,
and if he didn&rsquo;t have a good natured
bear, he&rsquo;d get his head knocked off. All he&rsquo;s
good for is to dance with a bear on the street
and hold out a tin cup for nickels. Nevertheless,
Allegretti, old boy, I&rsquo;ve got to scrape up
an acquaintance with you someway, for that&rsquo;s
on the road to the heart of Gwen, though how
she can stand the garlic and the look of your
ugly mug long enough to box a round with you
is more than I can understand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>While Johnny Thompson was watching the
performance, two little girls, sitting bolt upright
in their beds in the big house of Major MacDonald
in far-away Amaraza, were planning
wild things for the future. Through the aid of
their maid they had succeeded in securing for
themselves suits that would do with the circus&mdash;pink
tights, exceedingly short blue skirts, red
slippers and green caps. All that bright afternoon
they had spent in the back yard practicing
on their ponies. Standing up on the back of one
of them had been easy after the first few
attempts, but when Marjory had tried standing
with one foot on each pony she had slipped
down between them and had come near to being
crushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do that, too, some day,&rdquo; she had
exclaimed resolutely.</p>
<p>And now, before they went to sleep, they were
planning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Marjory was saying, &ldquo;that old
circus will come back here some time; I just
know it will! Maybe next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Johnny Thompson will be with it,&rdquo;
broke in Margaret. &ldquo;I just know he will, and
we&rsquo;ll get on our ponies when the parade is
started. We&rsquo;ll ride right in the parade, and
Johnny will see us and say, &lsquo;There are my
friends, Marjory and Margaret.&rsquo; Won&rsquo;t he be
proud of us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t he, though!&rdquo; The other twin clapped
her hands in high glee.</p>
<p>They went to sleep finally, still thinking of
Johnny and the circus, but little dreaming of
the remarkable and thrilling adventures in store
for them.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>That same night, after the circus tents had
been darkened, two strange things happened.
The first was never made public; the second was
the talk of the circus people the next morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>Scarcely had the last straggling sight-seer
wandered from the grounds, than two figures
emerged from the side entrance to a small tent.
They were followed at a distance by a third.
Darting directly for the wall that lined the railway
tracks, which at this point run some twelve
feet below the surface, but open to the air, they
scaled the wall, and, by the aid of a rope, let
themselves down to the track.</p>
<p>The third person, having followed them to the
wall and noted the direction they had taken,
contented himself with following along the wall.
Coming presently to some stairs, he crept
silently down, then having listened for a moment,
possibly for the sound of footsteps, he
peered down the track. For an instant a pale
crimson light flashed down the track. It might
easily have been mistaken for the glow of a
switch lantern. Then he pushed on after the
pair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>The two men left the tracks at Randolph
street and, taking a zigzag course, headed for
the river. Into a long, low-lying building facing
the stream they went. Not five minutes later
the individual who had followed them was braced
against a wall, peering in through a crack in a
broken window pane. What he saw within was
a low-ceilinged, dimly lighted room, furnished
only with a small table, four chairs and a dilapidated
chest of drawers. Four men were bent
over the table. The lines of their faces drawn
in eagerness, they were staring at some flat object
on the table. Soon one of them, with the
tips of his thumb and forefinger lifted the corner
of a sheet of paper. He had lifted it half
off from the flat object, to which it appeared to
cling, when a startling thing happened&mdash;the
room was suddenly illuminated with a brilliant
blood red light. This lasted only a fraction of a
second. The room was then left in darkness,
black as ink; for even the candle had been overturned
and snuffed out. From the darkness
there came the sound of overturned chairs, as
the four men made good their escape. By the
time they reached the open air their tracker had
vanished utterly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>He was, at that very moment, flattened against
the corner of a dark wall, and was quite as unhappy
over the turn of events as they were. At
the very instant when he was about to discover a
secret of vast importance, his foot had slipped,
his face bumped against the glass, and the unexpected
happened.</p>
<p>The second occurrence, the one which caused
much talk among the circus people, happened a
short time later. As the attendants reported it,
it would seem that their attention was first
attracted to the strange phenomenon by the
growl of a lion, whose cage was in the corner of
the tent. To their surprise, the cage, the lion,
and even the straw upon which he lay had turned
blood red. Hardly had they finished staring at
this than the snarl of a Siberian tiger at the
opposite corner had called them to note that the
red light, for light it must have been, had shifted
to the tiger&rsquo;s cage. The red glare had continued
to play hide and seek with the distracted
animals for fully five minutes and, during all
that time, not one of the attendants could detect
its source. At times it appeared to stream
down from the canvas top, then to shoot from
a corner, or to leap up from the floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>One notable fact was reported: In every instance
save one, the animals whose cages were
illuminated with crimson light cowered in a corner
in snarling fear. The single instance in
which this was not true was that of the black
leopard. That beast leaped, clawing and snarling,
at the bars of its cage, as if it would tear
the originator of the crimson flash limb from
limb.</p>
<p>As the report spread, the negroes of the troupe
were panic stricken. They quit in numbers.
The owners and managers were hard pressed
to keep enough men to do the menial work about
the tents, and sent the employment agent to
search the city for recruits. One of these recruits
chanced to be Snowball, the bullet-headed
friend of the strange hanger-on, Pant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><br />CHAPTER VI
<br />JOHNNY BOXES THE BEAR</h2>
<p>Johnny Thompson paced the beach up which
the waves of Lake Michigan were rolling. There
had been a storm, the aftermath of which was
even now coming in. Johnny&rsquo;s mind was in a
turmoil. He had been with the circus five days
now. Two more days they would remain in
Chicago. He was still groom for Millie Gonzales&rsquo;
three grays. Millie was as impossible as
ever. Three times she had struck at him with
her whip, when he had appeared to overstep his
rights as her menial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she has the ring, fine chance I&rsquo;ve got
unless I steal it from her,&rdquo; he grumbled.</p>
<p>Allegretti, the Italian boxer, was quite as
impossible as Millie. Once Johnny had bantered
him for a boxing match, but the fellow had
showed all his white teeth in a snarl as he said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No box-a da bum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had meant Johnny.</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s blood had boiled, but he had made
no response. Only when he was out of hearing,
he had declared, &ldquo;Never mind, old boy, I&rsquo;ll get
you yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But thus far he had not &ldquo;got&rdquo; him. The way
into the good graces of Gwen, queen of the circus,
seemed effectually blocked. He had not
tried approaching her, for he felt that would be
folly.</p>
<p>In spite of the sharply drawn lines of caste
which prevailed in the circus, life within the
tented walls when the performers were off duty
was astonishingly simple. Grease paint came off
at the end of the last act. About the dressing
tent and the assembly yard the women stars
appeared plain and simple-minded people. There
was nothing of the bravado that Johnny had
expected to find. The three girls who held the
center of his attention, because of the ring, were
wonderfully well-developed physically. Millie
was slender and quick as a cat. Mitzi von
Neutin, the trapeze performer, was also slender
and strong. She was French; Johnny knew that
from the many &ldquo;Mais, oui&rdquo; and her &ldquo;Mais,
non,&rdquo; with which she answered the questions
of the other performers. With her abundance
of yellow hair she was like a kitten, as she curled
up on a rug in the corner of the tent reading a
French novel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>But Gwen&mdash;Gwen was perfection itself. Not
too stout, not too thin; strong, yet not masculine,
she was indeed a queen. About the tent,
when off duty, she wore a short blue skirt and
a blue middy blouse open at the neck and tied
with a dark red ribbon. Twice Johnny had seen
her boxing with the Italian. Each time the
blood had rushed to his temples. To think of
such a queen taking her exercise with so coarse
a creature filled him with inward rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, he&rsquo;s of the caste,&rdquo; Johnny had
grumbled. &ldquo;No matter; so shall I be in time. I
don&rsquo;t know just how, but I will.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>Pant, too, had puzzled him greatly. He had
not forgotten his friend&rsquo;s uncanny power of seeing
in the dark. He had heard of the strange
appearance and disappearance of the crimson
flash in the animal tent and elsewhere, and suspected
that Pant was at the bottom of it, but
just what his game was, or what strange secret
of the power of light Pant possessed, he could
not guess.</p>
<p>Johnny had at last succeeded in buying the
five bonds which Pant had wanted. He had
obtained two of them for $39 each. These he
had bought from a fat, red faced man who was
a guard at the entrance to the big top. He was
even now waiting to deliver them to Pant.</p>
<p>Presently that individual came shuffling by,
and, motioning Johnny to follow him, continued
down the beach until they had found a secluded
spot in a turn of a breakwater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got &rsquo;em?&rdquo; Pant whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! Let&rsquo;s see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! Fine!&rdquo; he exclaimed, after he had
glanced over the bonds. &ldquo;Now can you tell me
who sold you these two together?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know his name; a fat, red faced fellow
at the entrance of the big top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! That&rsquo;s one of them. They&rsquo;re the
right kind, I&rsquo;ll wager. Let&rsquo;s see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant spread the bonds out on a broad plank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, only one!&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Getting careful,
I&rsquo;d say, Johnny.&rdquo; He turned suddenly. &ldquo;Would
you risk much for an old friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d do a lot for you, Pant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; Pant gripped his hand warmly.
&ldquo;Take these two bonds you got from that fat
fellow and sell them to-morrow to some dealer
in bonds on La Salle street. You bought them
for $39, did you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should get $45. Good little gain, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny grinned. He knew Pant too well to
think for a moment that he would engage in a
small business of trading in bonds two or three
at a time. What his real game was, he was
unable to guess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, old man. See you to-morrow,&rdquo; he
said, rising and tucking the bonds away in his
inner pocket. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hurry back now. I think
I&rsquo;m going to box the fellow who boxes the bear,
though how I am to arrange it, I can&rsquo;t quite
tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny wandered back to the big top. It was
late morning. Many of the circus people would
be in the big tent going through their stunts.</p>
<p>His hope of finding the boxer of the bear in
one of the rings was not in vain. He was, at the
moment of Johnny&rsquo;s entrance, in the act of putting
the bear through his mock heroic battle.</p>
<p>With an air of apparent indifference, Johnny
leaned against a center tent pole and watched
him. Allegretti hated being watched, Johnny
knew. That was why he lingered.</p>
<p>The Italian stood his scrutiny for three minutes,
then with an angry glare in his eye, he
cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go &rsquo;way, you bum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s only reply was a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go &rsquo;way! No can box-a da bear when you
all time loafin&rsquo; here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Italian was dancing with rage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t box anyway, so what&rsquo;s the difference?&rdquo;
Johnny grinned again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No can box?&rdquo; The Italian stormed, &ldquo;No
can box? You wan&rsquo;na see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, show me,&rdquo; Johnny grinned.</p>
<p>An extra pair of gloves lay near by. Allegretti
kicked them toward him. &ldquo;Putta dem on.
&lsquo;No can box,&rsquo; he says. Allegretti show dat
bum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He squared away in such an awkward manner
that Johnny found it hard to suppress a
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now where do you want me to hit you
first?&rdquo; Johnny asked politely.</p>
<p>The answer was a volley of quick blows,
which all fell upon Johnny&rsquo;s well managed
gloves.</p>
<p>When the Italian paused for breath, Johnny
tapped him lightly on the nose. Enraged at
being so easily scored upon, the fiery foreigner
fairly went wild in his efforts to reach Johnny
with a blow that would send him to the surgeon.
To avoid these wild swings was child&rsquo;s play for
Johnny. Time and again the Italian left him a
wide opening, but Johnny only further enraged
his opponent by tapping him lightly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>This farce lasted for five minutes. Johnny
was puzzled to know what to do. He knew that
the impostor, who called himself a boxer, was
completely within his power. By a single jab of
his powerful right, he could send him to dreamland.
This, however, was farthest from his
thought. To needlessly injure a man was never
part of Johnny&rsquo;s program.</p>
<p>A large, low, paper-topped barrel, used in the
trained dog act, stood within ten feet of them.
Suddenly Johnny resolved what he would do;
he would humiliate his opponent. Perhaps that
would bring him to terms.</p>
<p>Slowly he forced Allegretti back until he was
within five feet of the barrel when, with a quick
right to the chest, he lifted him off the ground
and landed him square in the center of the top
of the tub. There followed a ripping sound,
the paper burst, and Allegretti dropped from
sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>With a smile Johnny stood waiting the Italian&rsquo;s
reappearance, when, to his utter astonishment,
he was struck a sledge hammer blow in
the middle of the back.</p>
<p>The blow sent him sprawling. In a flash he
was on his feet, and faced about to meet this
new and powerful foe. Imagine his amazement
when he found himself facing, not a man but
a bear. With gloved forepaws, with broad
mouth grinning, the bear stood ready for his
share of the match.</p>
<p>What had happened was evident. The Italian
had neglected to remove the bear&rsquo;s gloves.
The bear had now entered the ring. Johnny
had a choice of facing him or running. It was
a novel experience, but he was not well acquainted
with flight, so he held his ground.</p>
<p>The bear advanced with none of the skill of
an experienced fighter. His training had been
superficial. He had been taught to swing his
arms in a certain way when his opponent swung
his as a signal. The bear, however, was six
times as heavy as Johnny. One fair smash in
the face with that giant paw would send Johnny
to the happy hunting grounds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>As Johnny squared back, with his guard high,
the bear hesitated, a quizzical, almost human
grin overspreading his face. Then, seeming to
get a signal to rush in, he came plowing forward,
striking straight out as he advanced.
Johnny sidestepped, and, leaping off his toes,
tapped him on the ear. It was a stinging blow.
Bruin&rsquo;s ears were sensitive. That blow came
near proving the undoing of Johnny, for instantly
flying into a rage, the bear forgot his
training. Dropping on all fours, he rushed at
Johnny with the fierceness of his forest ancestors.
Dodging this way and that, Johnny sought
to get in a felling blow, but in vain.</p>
<p>Again the bear reared upon his hind legs.
So quickly was this accomplished Johnny did not
escape the grappling swing which, open handed,
the bear let fly. The animal&rsquo;s stubby claws
raked his face, leaving three livid lines of red.
The matter was growing serious. Something
must be done quickly. Johnny did it. Watching
for an opening, he at last leaped high and
forward. His arm went up in one of his short,
lightning master blows. There was the sound
as of a steel trap sprung. The bear whirled in
a circle, then crumpled to earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your bear,&rdquo; panted Johnny, wiping
his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No box-a da bear,&rdquo; groaned the grief
stricken Italian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t
box fair. He scratches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You kill-a da bear. I get-a your goat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! The bear&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; grinned
Johnny. &ldquo;Just give him a lump of sugar and a
sniff of smelling salts. He&rsquo;s a bit dizzy, that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say!&rdquo; he said after a moment. &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t get my goat. I ain&rsquo;t got any. But I have
a notion that I&rsquo;ve got yours right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had, but the Italian wasn&rsquo;t to know it until
some hours later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>As he turned to walk away, Johnny noticed a
well built, wholesome looking girl in short skirt
and middy standing a short distance off. She
was looking his way and smiling. It was Gwen,
the queen. He wanted to go over and speak to
her. He was sure she had seen all that had
happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t afford to rush things too fast,&rdquo; he
whispered to himself and, turning toward the
bunk tent, he hastened away.</p>
<p>As an hour and a half remained before he
must go on duty, Johnny slicked up a bit and
went over to La Salle street to sell the bonds
which Pant had entrusted to his care. The first
two dealers he approached refused to buy; they
did not purchase bonds in such small lots. The
third looked Johnny over carefully, then examined
the bonds. After that, he wet the tip of his
right forefinger on a sponge and proceeded to
count out a handful of bills. These, with some
small change, he shoved beneath the lattice to
Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine day,&rdquo; he smiled, as he turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet,&rdquo; Johnny agreed, as he pocketed the
money.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>Out on the shore of the lake he found Pant.</p>
<p>The latter stared at him for a moment in
silence. He was looking at the three red lines
drawn on Johnny&rsquo;s face by the bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he whispered at last, &ldquo;give me those
bonds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, I,&rdquo; Johnny stared, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t got them? Where are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sold &rsquo;em as you said to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sold them? When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With that on your face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a low whistle, Pant sank down upon the
sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; demanded Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Nothing much. One of those bonds
was a counterfeit, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Counterfeit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you sent me to sell it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I should have told you. You&rsquo;d
have done it just the same. Anyway, you would
have, had I told you everything. But if I had
told you, that would have made you nervous and
spoiled everything. I&rsquo;m a marked man. I
couldn&rsquo;t go myself. How was I to know that
you&rsquo;d go and get branded in that fashion?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, well,&rdquo; he continued after a moment&rsquo;s
reflection, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all right, I&rsquo;m sure. The bond
was perfect except for one trifling detail. It
was a shade lighter print than those made by
Uncle Sam, and, after all, that&rsquo;s really nothing.
Who knows but the Government printer failed
to ink his rollers well some morning? I know it
was a counterfeit, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bent over and wrote a name in the sand,
then quickly erased it.</p>
<p>Johnny had read it. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Black McCree?&rdquo;
he asked promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He,&rdquo; Pant whispered, &ldquo;is the slickest forger
that ever lived, and the worst crook. We&rsquo;re
going to get him, you and I, Johnny. And he&rsquo;s
with the circus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did&mdash;did you ever see him?&rdquo; Johnny demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be sure. Perhaps. But we will,
Johnny, we will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment they sat there in silence; then
Johnny arose and without a word, walked away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br />CHAPTER VII
<br />NO BOX-A DA BEAR</h2>
<p>There was one particular part of the show
that afternoon which Johnny was anxious to
see. So anxious was he, indeed, that even the
danger and mystery connected with the sale of
the counterfeit Liberty Bonds were crowded
from his mind. So intent was he upon seeing it,
that he half neglected his duties, and received
for the first time, directly upon his cheek, a sharp
cut from Millie&rsquo;s whip. Even that failed to
make him angry. Once Millie&rsquo;s act was over,
and he had rushed the dapple grays to their
stable, he dashed out of the horse tent, through
the assembly grounds, under the canvas wall of
the big top and found himself at last beneath
the bleachers in a very good position to see what
was going on in the ring to the south of the
center.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>He breathed a sigh of satisfaction, as he saw
the swarthy Italian bear boxer, dressed in his
green suit, come marching pompously down the
sawdust trail toward the ring. The lumbering
silver tip bear was at his heels.</p>
<p>The first part of their performance, the ball
rolling, the stilt walking and bicycle riding, went
off very well. The expectant smile on Johnny&rsquo;s
genial face was beginning to fade when finally
boxing gloves were produced, and thrust upon
the fore paws of the waiting bear.</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s smile broadened. A wild look in the
bear&rsquo;s eyes told him that something was about
to happen.</p>
<p>It did happen, and that with lightninglike rapidity.
No sooner had the bear felt the gloves
upon his paws than, without waiting for signals,
he let drive a tremendous right swing at the
trainer&rsquo;s head. He missed by but a fraction of
an inch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zowie! What a wallop,&rdquo; whispered Johnny.
&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t forgotten. I thought he wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>Indeed, the bear had not forgotten the punishment
he had received earlier in the day and,
whether or not he had the intelligence to know
that Allegretti was no match for him, he had at
least resolved to demolish him as speedily as
possible, for hardly had the Italian recovered
from his surprise when a second blow aimed at
his chest sent him sprawling.</p>
<p>Leaping to his feet, the trainer waved his
arms in frantic signals. It was of no avail.
The bear had known the taste of victory. He
was not to be signaled.</p>
<p>Straight at his trainer he rushed. The Italian
uttered a shout of terror, then, closely followed
by the bear, bolted from the ring.</p>
<p>The spectators, thinking this was a part of
the play, howled and screamed as they rocked
with laughter.</p>
<p>To the Italian it was tragedy. Had not the
bear grown fat in idleness, and so impaired his
running power, the affair might have ended unfortunately
for Allegretti.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>As it was, having pursued his trainer halfway
down the length of the tent, the bear
paused, rose on his haunches, tore a glove from
his paw and aimed it with such force and accuracy
at the trainer&rsquo;s back that it sent him clawing
in the dust.</p>
<p>With one more yell, Allegretti rose and continued
his flight. The second glove missed its
mark. With mouth open, seemingly in a broad
grin, the bear&rsquo;s gaze swept the circle of delighted
spectators, then, appearing to forget all
about the incident, he dropped on all fours, and
allowed an attendant to lead him quietly away.</p>
<p>Johnny ducked for the assembly enclosure.
There he found the Italian waving his arms before
the manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No box-a da bear! No box-a da bear!&rdquo;
shouted Allegretti.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;d say you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; smiled the manager.
&ldquo;But you did better than that. You put on a
scream; you made &rsquo;em laugh their heads off.
Do that every day and I&rsquo;ll double your pay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; demanded the outraged trainer.
&ldquo;Do dat again! Not for five time, not for ten
time my pay. He want-a keel me, dat-a bear.
No box-a da bear. No more box-a dat-a bear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>No amount of argument could make Allegretti
change his mind. He was scared white.
Johnny and the bear had got his goat. He was
through. He would never box the bear again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the manager, turning to Johnny,
at last, &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s up to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up to me? How?&rdquo; gasped Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You crabbed the Italian&rsquo;s act by boxing the
bear. Now you&rsquo;ll have to become a professional
bear boxer, and box him yourself. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; said Johnny stoutly. &ldquo;Why,
I don&rsquo;t even know the signals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make up some of your own. Pete Treco,
the tumbler, used to be a bear boxer. He can
help you. We&rsquo;ll be out of Chicago in three days.
I&rsquo;ll give you till then to get in form. What
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all anybody can do. And say, if you
can get him to pull that stunt, chasing you,
throwing the glove and all that, the double pay
offer stands.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>Johnny caught his breath. His opportunity
had come. There had come a shake-up. In
three days there would be another, and he would
be &ldquo;shaken up&rdquo; to the position of a full-fledged
performer, or he would be shaken down out of
the circus altogether. Could he make it?</p>
<p>Closing his fists tight, he gritted between his
teeth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all that&rsquo;s good, I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fiery and high tempered Millie lost her groom
that very day.</p>
<p>As far as the circus people were concerned,
Johnny Thompson vanished. In a small tented
enclosure, eight hours out of every twenty-four
were spent in strenuous attempts to teach that
bear to do his bidding. It was a difficult task.
More times than one he barely dodged a sudden
swing of that powerful paw, which if it had
landed would have increased the demand for cut
flowers and slow music.</p>
<p>Pant alone saw him, and that after the shadows
had fallen. It was at such times that they
talked long of those other days in Arctic Siberia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pant,&rdquo; Johnny shot at his friend one night,
&ldquo;what are you here for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same back to you,&rdquo; smiled Pant. &ldquo;What
are you here for? You&rsquo;re not a circus man.
What interest can you have in learning to box
a bear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s deeper than that,&rdquo; smiled Johnny. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a matter of honor. There are three girls in
that circus I must get on speaking terms with.
The only way to do that is to become a performer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! It&rsquo;s a skirt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly&mdash;only a diamond ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, listen,&rdquo; and Johnny proceeded to tell
his story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s interesting,&rdquo; said Pant, &ldquo;and I think
I can help you. In fact, I think I am safe in
promising to tell you in time which of the three
girls has the ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell me? How?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that to me. I have ways of finding
things out. It can&rsquo;t be done here, though; on
the road, perhaps, or at a one-night stand. Wait
and see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; continued Pant, &ldquo;I want you to
promise to help me with my own mystery. It is
a much deeper and far more important affair.
You know the type of people that follow the
circus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, mixed with these little crooks is a big
one&mdash;a forger, a master counterfeiter. His
work is so good, as you know yourself, that it
can be passed on La Salle street, and that&rsquo;s going
some. I have several samples of his work. I
know they are counterfeits, yet there is not a
defect except the slight lack of color. They are
technically perfect. One would almost say they
were photographs of the real thing. These
bonds are being secretly passed out even here in
Chicago. When we get out into the safer small
cities, I have no doubt the state will be flooded
with them. It&rsquo;s an easy game. You know how
they work it: Circus employee has a bond he
has been saving, money all gone, must sell at a
sacrifice. Greedy rubes snatch them up. And
the worst of it is, they are so perfect that only
in cases where two of the same number chance
to come together will they be detected. With
the vast number of genuine bonds in the country,
this is likely never to happen. So there you
are. Why, I doubt if even the Treasury Department
itself could detect them. And this Black
McCree is at the bottom of it all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; Johnny bent forward
eagerly.</p>
<p>Pant smiled. &ldquo;He has a foolish habit of
scrawling his name about. He made the mistake
of scribbling it on one of the bonds which
later came into my hands. He&rsquo;s known to the
police the country over, not so much as counterfeiter,
however, as a &lsquo;Red&rsquo;&mdash;a dynamiter of
the worst type. He has more than once left his
scribbled name above a ghastly piece of work.
That is all they know of him. He has never
been identified. Just why he has decided to take
up the life of a sane crook and enter the forging
game, I can&rsquo;t tell unless&mdash;by George! I believe
I have it! Yes, sir! It&rsquo;s a financial plot!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Johnny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see? Our country is deeply in
debt. Every town and city is flooded with national
credit slips in the form of Liberty Bonds.
A nation&rsquo;s credit is its life. Now, if some slick
fellow can fill the safety boxes of the land with
bogus bonds, what is to become of the country&rsquo;s
credit? In time government bonds cannot be
sold at any price, for the would-be purchaser
cannot tell whether he is buying a genuine bond
or a counterfeit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; breathed Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; mused Pant, &ldquo;it may not be a plot,
after all. Perhaps this Black McCree thinks he
has discovered a way to get rich quick, and has
dropped his radical notions. They mostly drop
them when they fall heir to a piece of money.
But, anyway,&rdquo; he straightened up with a jerk,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to get him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he like?&rdquo; asked Johnny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what no one knows. He&rsquo;s never been
seen. He may be large or small. He may be,
for instance, a certain husky conman with a
ragged ear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very chap,&rdquo; exclaimed Johnny. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
a crook, all right. I caught him in a crooked
deal the other day. We had a little boxing
match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be sure he&rsquo;s the man,&rdquo; smiled
Pant. &ldquo;Small crooks seldom do big jobs, and big
crooks don&rsquo;t operate con games. Yet he&rsquo;ll bear
watching. He may be doing that as a blind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another fellow, though,&rdquo; Pant went
on, &ldquo;a midget clown&mdash;Tom Stick, a queer little
chap. He&rsquo;s the prize of the circus. Dresses
like a mosquito, and drives a huge elephant
around the ring. Strange part about him is, he
insists on living all by himself in a little house
built on wheels. Far as I know, no one has
ever been allowed inside that house of his. You
see the chance, don&rsquo;t you? He could have all
kinds of an outfit in there, and no one would
be the wiser. Of course, he wouldn&rsquo;t sell many
bonds himself; he&rsquo;d pass &rsquo;em out through others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a third fellow, a cook, the steam kettle
cook, Andy McQueen. Don&rsquo;t know so much
about him. What I want you to do is to get
acquainted with these men and see what you can
find out. You&rsquo;re on the inside, so you can do it.
There&rsquo;s another fellow, he&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that juncture the conversation was ended
by the appearance of a party rounding a sand
pile, and Johnny hastened back to the tented
grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m crazy to get in my first performance,&rdquo;
he told himself. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s successful, it&rsquo;ll put me
on even ground with Gwen, the Queen. Then
we&rsquo;ll see what we shall see. She looks mighty
interesting, to say the least.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><br />CHAPTER VIII
<br />THE GIRL AND THE TIGER</h2>
<p>Late that night Johnny Thompson was reminded
for the hundredth time of his position
as a serf among the knights and ladies of the
circus. He was just passing into the now almost
deserted big top when he came face to face with
Millie Gonzales. In sudden embarrassment he
was about to speak to her and doff his cap when,
with chin in air, she swept past him.</p>
<p>Setting his teeth hard, Johnny hastened on.
Only when he was at a safe distance did he give
vent to his feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for the ring, I wouldn&rsquo;t stand
for it,&rdquo; he raged in a whisper, &ldquo;I, I&rsquo;d, well, I&rsquo;d
make her bite her own sharp tongue. Maybe,&rdquo;
he reflected, &ldquo;maybe some time I will.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>The incident was soon forgotten, and it was
not so long after that Johnny was made to realize
that not all the ladies of the circus were like
Millie, not even those who ranked above her.</p>
<p>In a dark corner of the tent, Johnny threw
himself on a pile of netting to think. Life had
grown strangely complicated for him since he
had joined the show. Problems great and small
lay before him for solving. It was like a lesson
in algebra. There was the problem of boxing
the bear. His ability to solve that problem
would be tested all too soon, on the day after
to-morrow. In some small city he would have
his try-out. Depending upon the successful solving
of this problem was the other and more
important one, that of the ring. Who had it?
Millie, the bareback rider, Mitzi, the trapeze
performer, or Gwen, the dancing queen of the
tight wire? Thus far he had not the slightest
clue. If one of them had it, she never had worn
it while Johnny was in sight. Could it be that
the one in possession of it suspected him of
seeking it? That did not seem probable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;stranger things have
happened. She may have seen me make that
foolhardy dash for it when the elephant flicked
it from the chain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at once his mind swept on to the third
and most important problem of all&mdash;Pant&rsquo;s
problem, the problem of the counterfeit bonds.
Pant had named three men who might be responsible,
the conman of the ragged ear, the
midget clown, the steam kettle cook. Johnny
Thompson was one of the kind of fellows who,
when they recognize a great and important problem,
set themselves to solving it, leaving all
minor difficulties to take care of themselves. As
he lay there now, he realized that Pant&rsquo;s problem
had already become his; that for the time
being, the ring might be all but forgotten. And
yet he hoped that, as the more important and
difficult problem was being solved, this one of
lesser importance would work itself out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway,&rdquo; he mumbled, half rising,
&ldquo;my success at boxing the bear comes first, for
unless I put that stunt across, I will have precious
little chance to discover the whereabouts
of the ring, or to help Pant run down the counterfeiter.
To-morrow&rsquo;s my last day of training.
Me for my bunk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>But just as he was about to get upon his feet
he checked himself and sank back in his place.
A vision had struck his eye&mdash;a vision of lithe
wonder and beauty. It was dancing along a
silver wire.</p>
<p>It was Gwen, Queen of the circus. The great
tent was totally dark, save for the corner where
she practiced. She had arranged a spot light in
such a manner that its brilliant rays struck
squarely across the tightly drawn wire, and
there in that light, which was flashed back by
her brilliant costume and her tossing umbrella,
she was performing all unconscious that anyone
was watching her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>Johnny Thompson thought he was the only
onlooker, and perhaps at first he was. If so, it
was not for long. Had he but known the nature
of that other spectator, he might have leaped to
his feet and rushed to warn the queen of her
danger. Not knowing, he sat entranced by the
wonderful apparition who seemed more a being
of another world, or perhaps some tropical bird,
as she flitted from end to end of that silver wire.
Now she rose straight in air and, seeming to
soar aloft, swept down to the wire again. And
now she dropped upon her hands to bend and
twist in a blinding whirl, while her gleaming
parasol spun above her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; Johnny breathed; then again, &ldquo;Um!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what was that? He thought he detected
a stealthy movement to the right of him. It
might have been but the swaying of a tent pole
shaken by the wind, but he kept his eyes upon
the spot for some time. He had concluded it
was nothing, and was about to turn his attention
to the girl again, when the movement came
again, this time closer at hand. At the same
time he heard a sound that in a place less quiet
to an untrained ear would be nothing at all. To
Johnny it spoke of danger&mdash;perhaps danger to
himself, perhaps to the girl. He thought of the
counterfeiters. Did they know he had joined
Pant in the task of hunting them down, and
realizing his importance as an inside man, had
they decided to do away with him at once? Or
was this some enemy of the beautiful dancer?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>Danger, Johnny had learned, loses much of its
terror when squarely faced. He now threw himself
upon the sawdust and began creeping, knife
in hand, toward the spot from which the sound
had come.</p>
<p>Ten feet he crawled, then paused to listen. In
the stillness he heard the occasional creak of the
wire, the spatter of the spot light. Then again
he caught that gliding sound. It was retreating
from him, moving closer to the girl. This time
he crept twenty feet or more before he paused.
Again the same sounds greeted his strained ears.
Again the gliding sound. The creature, whether
beast or human, traveling faster than he, must
be not more than thirty feet from the swinging,
swaying girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>And now, like a flash, his eyes, for a moment
relieved from the dancer&rsquo;s dazzling light, saw
the creature&mdash;a gaunt tawny beast it was, a
tiger stalking human prey. For a second Johnny
shivered and shrank back. How had this creature
escaped? This he could not know. Its purpose
was all too evident. Attracted by the gleam
of the fairylike figure dancing on the wire, it
was thinking only of breaking her bones with
its yellow fangs.</p>
<p>Johnny paused for half a minute, then resumed
his forward movement. Poorly armed as
he was, he would not allow the beast to have its
way unopposed.</p>
<p>Yet, after covering another yard or two, he
paused. The girl was ten feet in air. Did the
tiger have the power to leap that high? For a
tiger of the jungle this would be no feat at all,
but for this one of the cage, Johnny was in
doubt. And Gwen? Did she have the iron nerve
to keep on dancing down the wire with a great
yellow beast leaping madly for her feet?</p>
<p>It was a tense moment. Every muscle in his
body quivered. The hand that gripped his knife
almost crushed the hilt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>The questions that surged through his brain
were not long in being answered, for now, in the
dim half light about her, the girl saw the beast.
For one brief second her eyes were dilated with
fear. The parasol, trembling, wavering, almost
slipped from her grasp.</p>
<p>Johnny rose on one knee. &ldquo;If she falls? If
she falls?&rdquo; he breathed silently.</p>
<p>But she did not fall. Seeming to summon all
her nerve and strength, she held her parasol
high and once more danced gracefully down the
wire.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Two hours before this moment in our story,
Pant had left the circus grounds, and, crossing
a viaduct over the tracks, had made his way
down the avenue toward the river. As he cut
across the roadway and lost himself down a
dark alley near the river, he might have been
heard saying to himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bear, driven from his lair, returns; the
rabbit circles back to his brush pile; sometimes
crooks return to their rendezvous. I wonder if
they will this time? Well, we shall see what we
shall see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>He was by this time nearing a long, low-lying
building that flanked the river. Before a door
which was reached by three downward steps, he
paused. All was dark, silent, mysterious. For
a moment he listened intently, then after a hasty
glance up and down the deserted alley, he darted
to a low, narrow window. His efforts to lift
the sash were fruitless. Quickly drawing a thin-bladed
knife from his pocket, he inserted the
blade beneath the catch. There was a click.
The next instant Pant had lifted the sash, dived
through and closed the window after him.</p>
<p>The room was utterly dark, yet he appeared
to have no difficulty in finding his way about the
place. Whether he had a previous knowledge
of the building, was endowed with an instinctive
sense of location of things, or could see in the
dark, would have been a question too difficult
for a casual thinker to answer. An observer,
had there been one, might have said that the
room had a strange way of flashing crimson for
a fraction of a second, then becoming inky black
again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>After moving about for a time, Pant doubled
himself up and, creeping into the broad lower
part of a dilapidated cupboard, closed the door
behind him.</p>
<p>Ten minutes elapsed. A rat scurried over the
uneven floor. Another creeping through a hole
in the base of the cupboard, began rattling a
loose bit of board about. Pant kicked at it.
Then all was silent again.</p>
<p>Five minutes more passed. Three rats had
ventured out upon the floor when, of a sudden,
there sounded the rattle of a key in the outer
door. The rats scurried away. Pant caught a
quick breath, as he whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They return!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A match was struck. A broad, fat face appeared
at the door. The man&rsquo;s small, beady
eyes peered about the place for a moment, then
he whispered back over his shoulder:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. C&rsquo;m&rsquo;on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>Two other men followed him. One was slim,
the other broad shouldered. Pant almost let
fall an exclamation, as he saw that the broad-shouldered
one had a ragged ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Johnny&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; was his mental
comment.</p>
<p>Through a hole left by what had once been
a lock on the cupboard door, he could catch every
move of the mysterious three.</p>
<p>Gathering around the table they proceeded at
once to what appeared to be the task of the
night. A flat tin affair was placed on the table.
A tin cup from which the handle of a brush protruded
was set down close to the pan. A roll of
paper was produced. It was while this was
being rolled backward and then drawn across
the smooth edge of the table to make it straight
that Pant felt something touch his hand. Barely
checking a start, he held himself rigidly motionless.
In an instant he realized that it was only
a hungry rat. But in a minute he knew that
this was quite bad enough, for the rat began to
gnaw at his finger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>In the meantime, in the room the man of the
ragged ear had taken the broad brush and moved
it several times over the pan. He dipped the
brush each time in the cup, as if applying a
liquid. The fat man held a sheet of paper as if
ready to spread it out upon the pan.</p>
<p>The rat persevered. He had gnawed his way
through the tough outer skin of Pant&rsquo;s finger,
and had touched tender flesh when, with a sudden
quick movement, Pant&rsquo;s thumb closed down.
He was not quick enough. The rat, whirling
about, was caught only by the tail. With a
piercing, almost human scream the rat struggled
for freedom.</p>
<p>Instantly the room went dark. In that same
instant, a hand groped for the door, behind
which Pant was concealed. Pant had hoped to
strangle the rat without a sound. In this he had
failed. Just what he was in for now, he could
not even guess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><br />CHAPTER IX
<br />THE TIGER SPRINGS</h2>
<p>In the dim half light, as Johnny crouched in
the sawdust ring, knife in hand, he saw the tiger
lash his tail as he prepared for a spring. He
saw the girl dancing on the wire, twirling her
parasol as she danced. His mind whirled. Was
this all a dream? Was it but a moving picture
flashed upon the screen? He shook himself.
No, there were the colors in the girl&rsquo;s costume,
the red that came and went in her cheek, and
there were the wonderful colors in the coat of
that giant cat. It was real, and the cat was preparing
for a spring. Should he cry out? Attract
the beast&rsquo;s attention, then stand for battle?
To do so meant sudden death. No man armed
with a knife could hope to defeat a tiger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>On the other hand, what if he waited? Could
the tiger leap ten feet in air? If he could, what
then? The girl had nerve; Johnny could see
that. There was a strong chance that the tiger
could not reach her. He would wait.</p>
<p>Suddenly into that brilliant circle of light
there shot upward a tawny, gleaming body.
The tiger had leaped square at the girl. Johnny&rsquo;s
heart stood still. There came an audible gasp
from the girl. The cruel fangs of the beast
flashed in the light. Up, up he rose, five feet,
six, seven, eight. Now his great paws flashed at
the girl&rsquo;s feet. An instant of suspense ended
with a gasp of relief. The tiger had missed.</p>
<p>For a fraction of a second the girl teetered
on the wire. She seemed about to lose her balance
and fall, but she at once regained her composure,
and, with a smile upon her lips, such
as she threw to admiring spectators, she tripped
again along the wire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s lips formed the word,
but he did not say it.</p>
<p>Again the tiger crouched for a spring. The
girl was gaining self-control. Estimating the
position of the tiger, she tripped away from him.
Angered, the tiger roared savagely, gave two
short jumps, then leaped straight and high.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>With a little cry, half of fear, half of defiance,
the girl sprang in air. The next instant
the tiger&rsquo;s paw touched the wire. One breathless
second the girl appeared to hover in air,
then she dropped. Her toe touched the vibrating
wire. She slipped. She uttered a low moan.</p>
<p>Just at that moment the spot light blinked
suddenly out, leaving the great tent in utter
darkness.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>For a few moments after the candle was extinguished
in the mysterious room down by the
river Pant remained motionless. Then, as a
groping hand found the door to his hiding place,
he leaped into spring-steel-like action. The cupboard
door banged open. A sudden flash of red
light was followed by the dull thud of a body
striking the floor. A second flash produced the
same result. A chair clattered to the floor. The
street door swung suddenly open, then banged
shut again. A fugitive figure sought cover in
the shadows of a dark corner of the building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you shot?&rdquo; came a gruff voice from
within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought I was, but guess I ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t any report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A red flame, and a biff that floored!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There followed sounds of movement. A
match was struck. For a moment a light flickered
in the room, then three heads appeared at
the door. Mounting to the third step, the leader
glanced quickly up and down the street. Then,
followed by his two companions, he darted away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some rotten luck,&rdquo; grumbled Pant, for it
was he who lurked in the corner.</p>
<p>Without a light, he again entered the room.
When he came out a short time later, he was
straightening out a bit of crumpled paper.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>For Johnny, after the spot light in the circus
tent blinked out, an agony of suspense followed.
The girl&mdash;had she dropped? The tiger&mdash;was
he now about to spring? Without a light Johnny
could do nothing. A sudden wave of remorse
overcame him. He blamed himself for not entering
the struggle when the light was on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>But what was this? Could it be that his
straining ear caught the sing of the wire, as
the girl&rsquo;s foot touched it in her wild dance? He
listened. There could be no mistake about it.
Even in the darkness she had regained her footing,
was dancing down the wire.</p>
<p>But the tiger could see in the dark. She could
not see his leaps. And he would leap again,
Johnny was sure of that.</p>
<p>In this he was not mistaken, for, with sinking
sensation, he heard the cat leave the ground.
There followed no sound. Breathlessly he
waited till he felt the slight shock of the cat as
he dropped. Or was it Gwen?</p>
<p>At this time of uncertainty a weird thing happened.
Seeming to come from a spot in mid
air, a streak of crimson light flashed down at an
angle toward the floor. For an instant, it turned
the costume, the parasol, the face of the girl
crimson; the next, it swept the crouching tiger
with a flood of blood red light. With a growl
of fear the beast shrank back. The light followed
him. He rose and leaped away. He
paused. The light was again upon him. With
a wild snarl, he sprang away toward the far end
of the tent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>As he lay there staring open-mouthed,
Johnny heard the sputter of arc lights. In a
moment the tent was ablaze with white lights.
The dynamo had been started, the light
turned on.</p>
<p>Johnny sprang to his feet, then facing about,
looked for the girl. The next instant he sprang
toward the spot over which the wire was strung.
He was there in time to break her fall. She
had tottered from the wire.</p>
<p>She had not fainted, but it was in vain that
she attempted to rise; her limbs would not support
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, I guess I lost my nerve,&rdquo; she apologized,
as she sank down upon the sawdust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you did, you lost a lot,&rdquo; exclaimed Johnny
in undisguised enthusiasm. &ldquo;You were great!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>For the moment he forgot the caste of the
circus, forgot he was only an ex-groom and she
the queen of performers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just sit right here,&rdquo; he counseled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run
and get you a glass of water; you&rsquo;ll be all right
in a jiffy. The tiger&rsquo;s safe enough; keepers
have got him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time he returned, the world had
righted itself again, and he was only a slave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, I&rsquo;ll be running along,&rdquo; he stammered,
&ldquo;that is, if you&rsquo;re all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not all right,&rdquo; protested Gwen. &ldquo;Besides,
I need some one to talk to. Why should
you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; Johnny faltered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a performer;
at least, not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fiddle!&rdquo; she puckered up her lips. &ldquo;What
diff does that make; you&rsquo;re a brave boy. You
were right near that awful tiger when I saw
you, and you weren&rsquo;t running away. I believe
you were there all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; admitted Johnny. &ldquo;I was watching
you dance when he came up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; She gave him a queer look. &ldquo;And
what did you think you could do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he had reached you, I could have put up
a good scrap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him again. &ldquo;I believe you
could,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;I saw you give that bear
the knockout the other day. That was good,
awful good! Say! You can box, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you give me some lessons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s heart leaped. Would he?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Su&mdash;sure,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;any&mdash;any
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; to-morrow morning at nine. What
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That suits me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a go,&rdquo; she said, holding out her hand.
Johnny gripped it warmly, and as he did so, he
realized that there was nothing soft or flabby
about that hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she half apologized, &ldquo;I have to
keep in trim for my stunts, and nothing will do
it quite like boxing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Uh-huh!&rdquo; Johnny scarcely heard her. Her
hand had made him think of the diamond ring.
Should he ask her about it now? It seemed
what his old professor would call the psychological
moment. Yet he did not want to ask her.
He was already enjoying her friendship, knew
he would enjoy it more and more and did not
wish to risk losing it. Then he thought of Pant
and his problem. Perhaps she could aid them
in solving that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; she whispered suddenly, &ldquo;what was
that blood red light?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Johnny replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it spooky? Came from nowhere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how it was done,&rdquo; said Johnny,
&ldquo;but someone was behind it&mdash;someone who evidently
wanted to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl glanced at him sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do it. I&rsquo;m not
that much of a magician. But I&rsquo;m not sure but
that I know the person who did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Will you find out and
let me know?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I can,&rdquo; said Johnny, smiling once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she gasped again. &ldquo;I owe that person
a lot. The tiger would have got me for sure.
I&rsquo;d do a lot for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you?&rdquo; asked Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have a chance some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strangely you talk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I can tell you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He arose and, assisting her to her feet, walked
with her to the flap of the ladies&rsquo; dressing tent;
then bade her good-night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a real sport!&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Now
I&rsquo;ve got to make good at boxing the bear, even
if it is a rotten job.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><br />CHAPTER X
<br />GWEN MEETS A &ldquo;HAY MAKER&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Johnny Thompson did not relish giving boxing
lessons. Like all true artists, he was more interested
in doing things than in teaching others
how to do them. Especially did he dislike giving
lessons to women.</p>
<p>Johnny had his particular ideas about the possible
skill of lady boxers and his estimate was
not flattering. However, he was willing to
teach Gwen because he liked her, thought of her
as a good sport, and hoped to profit by his acquaintance
with her. He was destined to find
her rather a surprise as a boxer.</p>
<p>Exactly at nine o&rsquo;clock next morning he was
on hand in the small sawdust circle at a remote
corner of the &ldquo;big top.&rdquo; Gwen was only three
minutes late and Johnny put that down as being
much to her credit. &ldquo;Most girls would have
been fifteen minutes or half an hour behind
time,&rdquo; was his mental comment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>After a formal &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; Johnny
helped Gwen on with her gloves. This gave him
an opportunity to look her over. Naturally her
hands received his first attention. He looked
for rings; found none, and then laughed at himself
for believing that any person would come
for a boxing lesson with rings on her fingers.</p>
<p>Looking her up and down from head to toe,
he found her good to the eye&mdash;even better than
in her professional costume. She was all of a
girl now. In her short skirt, blue middie and
silk stockings and with her mass of hair drawn
tightly into form beneath a strong net, she made
a picture worth looking at. Johnny found himself
catching his breath sharply as he drew on
her gloves and laced them snugly about her
wrists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t strike hard&mdash;not at first, anyway&mdash;will
you?&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Johnny smiled, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll
have to be careful about one thing; practice
calls for boxing that is as near the real thing
as possible. I mean that I&rsquo;ll seem to be going to
deal you a real knock-out blow, but I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;pull
the blow,&rsquo; as they say, just before it lands, so it
will be a mere tap. The thing you&rsquo;ll have to be
a little careful about is running into those &lsquo;hay
makers,&rsquo; otherwise they may prove to be the real
thing in spite of all I can do to avoid it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; Gwen smiled back. &ldquo;Are you
ready?&rdquo; She tapped him playfully on the nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready!&rdquo; Johnny squared away.</p>
<p>From the start, Gwen&rsquo;s boxing was a baffling
mystery to the boy. She seemed to fairly
dance on air. Her foot movements were marvelous.
Now she was here; now there; now in
another corner of the ring. Johnny had been
called the fastest boy of the ring, but Gwen was
faster. For some time he did not reach her
even with a light tap.</p>
<p>But time taught him new tricks and brought
back to his mind many half-forgotten old ones.
He began to realize that, although her face protection
was perfect, she was exposing her chest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where her lesson begins,&rdquo; he told
himself, and at once began tapping her over the
heart with ever increasing force until she threw
down her hands with a sharp, &ldquo;Oh-wee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time&rsquo;s up,&rdquo; laughed Johnny, throwing himself
down upon the mat and inviting her to do
the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he explained, when they had
caught their breath, &ldquo;you box the way you do
your tight rope work. It&rsquo;s great stuff. I never
saw a lady boxer your equal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwen gave him a happy smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got your weak
points, just as the rest of us have. You play
your defense too high. That leaves your chest
unguarded. If you were in a real fight your
opponent would deal you a knock-out blow over
the heart. You&rsquo;ll have to practice playing closer
to the sawdust with both your hands and your
feet. It&rsquo;s that tight rope stuff that does it. You
box as if you were tiptoeing along the rope and
holding up that Japanese parasol to balance
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>Gwen thanked him for his advice, then, as all
good friends occasionally do, they lapsed into
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second round,&rdquo; said Johnny, two minutes
later as he pocketed his watch.</p>
<p>To Johnny this tight rope dancer seemed an
amazingly alert pupil. It was no time at all
before he found her guard lowered and her
hands traveling so fast that only now and again
was he able to score a point. To his great surprise,
he found himself thoroughly enjoying the
third round. Not only was he teaching her something
about guarding and self-control, but she
was giving him pointers in speed and foot work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re great!&rdquo; he breathed at the end of
the third round. &ldquo;You really are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flushed, highly excited, filled with a girlish
enthusiasm, she beamed back at him. The affair
was a huge success; there could be no doubt
of that. Johnny saw himself safely possessed
of an entirely agreeable pal, one of the very
elect, of the inner circle of star performers,
too. He saw himself frolicking with this wonderful
pal day after day. A fine day-dream!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>And just there something happened, as often
is the case when one&rsquo;s cup of happiness is about
to overflow. In the fourth round Gwen, excited
by Johnny&rsquo;s praise, strove to out-do herself. Before
she had not been half so airy nor so nimble
and skillful in eluding her opponent&rsquo;s blows.
Thus challenged, Johnny brought into play his
every tactic. Maneuvers which had lain dormant
in his brain leaped to the forefront. It
was as if he were again in a real battle in a real
ring. Like live things, his gloves flashed. He
leaped to the right, then to the left, then backward.
He darted suddenly forward. He ducked.
He leaped high. But ever the elusive Gwen
escaped him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>At last, in one mad rush he found himself
facing her. Her round chin was exposed. What
an opportunity! He lifted himself clean off the
floor; his right hand struck out and up. It
would have brushed her chin&mdash;an admirably
&ldquo;pulled&rdquo; blow&mdash;had she not at this instant
leaped suddenly at him. Whether she thought
she saw an opening and had herself resolved to
score, or had, in the mad rush, completely lost
her head, Johnny could not tell. He only knew
that there came a sickening sound of impact,
followed by a dull thud and Gwen lay crumpled,
unconscious at his feet. His blow had found
its mark. The full force of it had been expended
on the girl&rsquo;s chin!</p>
<p>Heartsick, he struggled to regain his scattered
senses. The next instant he was rushing away
for water. From a bucket he dipped it ice cold,
and applied it to her forehead. Then with a
towel he began to fan her.</p>
<p>All the time reflections were rushing through
his troubled brain: &ldquo;What a fool! Just when
things were going right! All off now! Mighty
funny how it happened! All my fault! Mebby
hers, too! But a girl&mdash;what a wallop to give
a girl! Who&rsquo;d forgive it? Boss&rsquo;d fire me if he
knew it. What a muss! Go back to the bear
if I get a chance. Bear&rsquo;s about my class. What
a nut a fellow can make of himself! I&mdash;why
dum it anyway&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>His dismal reflections were arrested by the
opening of Gwen&rsquo;s eyes. She sat up dizzily and
gazed about her as if looking upon a world
unknown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she
moaned, and held her head.</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s thoughts touched the bottom of
despair.</p>
<p>But the next moment she was looking at him
and actually smiling. &ldquo;I suppo-pose,&rdquo; she said
uncertainly, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;d call&mdash;call that a &lsquo;hay&mdash;hay
maker&rsquo;?&ldquo;</p>
<p>Johnny grinned in spite of himself. &ldquo;It was,&rdquo;
he agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&mdash;I ran into your &lsquo;hay maker.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that,&rdquo; Johnny agreed, sitting
down beside her. &ldquo;I hope you feel better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not answer, but sat staring at the sawdust.
They remained in just that position until
Johnny&rsquo;s watch had ticked off a hundred and
twenty seconds. He knew it was a hundred and
twenty for he counted them all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said, when he could endure
the silence no longer, &ldquo;that that&rsquo;s the end of
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; she agreed.</p>
<p>Again they were silent. There seemed nothing
more to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I thought we would have some grand
times together,&rdquo; said Johnny, at last. &ldquo;I might
have known though&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! But aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; There was a puzzled
look on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! You&mdash;you said that was the end
of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so for today. I&rsquo;m really too
shaky to box any more to-day. But how about
to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a wild shout of joy, Johnny leaped to
his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;then&mdash;,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;Why,
you&rsquo;re a brick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He extended his hand and helped her to her
feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why? What&rsquo;s so wonderful?&rdquo; she smiled at
him. &ldquo;I ran into you and got bumped. I don&rsquo;t
hold that against you. Why should I? Would
another boy hate you for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. He might not, but a girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fiddle! Girls are just like boys, if you let
them be. Shall I see you to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Johnny hesitated before taking
her hand for a farewell; the question of the
diamond ring had flashed through his mind.
Was this the time to ask? He hesitated; then
gave it up. A moment before he had felt that
he had lost her. He would risk nothing more
this day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye and good luck,&rdquo; he murmured, as
she turned to go her way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br />CHAPTER XI
<br />THE BLACK BEAST</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Pant,&rdquo; said Johnny the next evening, as they
sat upon the beach in the moonlight, with the
tom, tom, tom of the circus drum sounding from
the distance, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s one thing that puzzles me
about this crimson flash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear.&rdquo; There was a smile lurking
about the corners of Pant&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That big yellow cat last night was scared
stiff, just frozen in his tracks by the crimson
flash,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;They tell me that all the
big cats act that way, except one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh!&rdquo; grunted Pant. &ldquo;The black panther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He leaps right at it, wants to eat someone
up every time it&rsquo;s flashed on his cage. How&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo; asked Johnny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>Pant smiled, as he drank in a deep breath of
cool, night air. &ldquo;That, Johnny, is a rather long
story, a story I&rsquo;ve never told. But, because
you&rsquo;ve been a good pal, because, though I&rsquo;ve
doubtless seemed mighty queer at times, you&rsquo;ve
never asked a leading question, I&rsquo;ve a strong
notion to tell it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny waited in silence. The tom tom of the
drum ceased. By that he knew that Gwen,
Queen of the circus, was just entering the ring
for her part. He had intended to see that act
again, but if Pant spoke&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I will,&rdquo; mused Pant. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he
went on, &ldquo;ever since I was a small child I have
had a great interest in cats. Even before I could
walk, so they tell me, I would turn up missing,
and they&rsquo;d find me at last creeping through the
grass in the meadows, following an old tomato
colored cat that was hunting for moles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As I grew older I came to know that a cat
could see in the dark, and that he did most of
his hunting at night. These things interested
me. Night after night I would slip from my
bed, steal out into the night and follow the cats
in their nightly wanderings. I guess I learned
things about cats that no one else knows; some
of their secrets, I mean. I&rsquo;ve never told them,
and I&rsquo;m not going to tell them to you. Knowledge
is of very little use to people unless they
go to the places where it can be applied, and
very few are willing to go all that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was thrown out into the world to
shift for myself I still wanted to know more
about cats. Little by little I came to know that
house cats were but the pygmies among cats;
that there were large, fierce, dangerous cats&mdash;wild
cats, mountain lions, tigers, and the like.
It was just when my curiosity about these big
cats was at its height that I happened to wander
into a zoo. There I found tigers, panthers,
leopards and mountain lions. I was wild with
joy. I watched these big cats for hours. I
asked so many questions of the attendant that
he threatened to throw me out. When night
came he did force me to go away. For a week
I did nothing but haunt that zoo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;At last it came to me suddenly one day that
I could learn nothing really worth while about
these wonderful cats unless I could watch them,
as I had watched house cats, in their native
haunts, as they rested, fed, played and wandered
about or stalked their prey. I asked the keeper
where their native homes were. He showed me
on a map. I was astonished. They were from
all over the world, India, Africa, South America,
everywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were two cats that had caught my
eye, the great tawny beast, the Bengal tiger,
and the smaller black cat with the shifting eye,
the black leopard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was told that both these came from
the jungles of India I was overjoyed. I would
go there and follow them day after day, until
I knew all their secrets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I told the attendant of my resolve, he
laughed at me; said I&rsquo;d be killed and eaten before
I had been in the jungle a day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I took to thinking about that; then I tried
to study out some way to make the great cats
of the jungle afraid of me. I returned again to
the zoo and studied the great animals. When
the keeper was not looking I tried many things.
At last I found one thing that would make them
afraid&mdash;all but one, the black cat with the shifting
eyes; he was not afraid. He leaped at his
bars snarling, but I said to myself, &lsquo;He is only
one, all other black leopards will be afraid.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the crimson flash?&rdquo; whispered Johnny.</p>
<p>Pant gave him a look of warning, then
glanced away at the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only a boy and not very far in my
teens at that, but I went to the jungles of India.
I don&rsquo;t remember much how I went. I was a
stowaway on a big steamer, then in a smaller
one. I helped pole long, heavy barges up an
endless river where mosses and grape vines
hung thick along the banks, and where great
slimy beasts rose from the water to glare at us.
I caught the fever and lay for weeks in a bed
of a hospital provided for Dutch missionaries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;After I got well, I poled more boats up the
river until, at last, I was in the heart of India,
where there were few white men, where there
were many naked natives, where it was all
jungle, and where in the night I could hear the
call of the wild things, my friends, the great
cats. Ah, my boy! Then I was happy. I
would study. I would learn secrets. I would
know things that no other man knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant paused and, rising, began to pace restlessly
back and forth, and Johnny, watching,
was reminded of the great Bengal tiger pacing
the length of his cage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a mission station,&rdquo; Pant went on,
still pacing to and fro; &ldquo;a little mission, with a
tiny hospital and a doctor. It was in a native
village at the edge of a great jungle. The natives
swarmed to it from many miles around.
When I asked the gray haired doctor why they
didn&rsquo;t have a large hospital, he shook his head
and answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No money.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I had a little money; I gave him that, and
he let me stay there with them. There were
just his wife and one nurse and the servants. I
did little things for them about the place the
time I was not sleeping during the day. At
night I went out into the jungle alone. That
first night, when they saw me starting out, they
called me back; told me there were great cats
lurking in the jungle that would kill and eat
me; begged me not to go, but I said to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have a charmed life. Nothing can harm
me. Besides, all cats are my friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Pant sat down upon the sand,
&ldquo;you see, I didn&rsquo;t want to tell my secret. Never
tell your secrets, Johnny, at least not all of them.
You&rsquo;ll mean more to your friends and trouble
your enemies more if you keep them. I kept
mine; but I went out into the jungle alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found them, Johnny; I found the great
tawny cats with the dark stripes, the tigers.
They were not hard to find, for I knew the
secrets of cats, and all cats are alike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First I found the old tiger, then his mate.
They were hunting in the tall grass. Right
away, when they saw me, they wanted to hunt
me and take me home to their cubs. But there
I had them. There was my great secret. When
I showed them what I could do, they were
afraid. They walked round and round me until,
in the morning, the grass was all trampled round
in a circle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The next night I found their cubs playing
near the roots of a fallen tree. They were three
months old&mdash;big as dogs. The father had
broken the forelegs of a deer, and had brought
it home for them to kill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they saw me, the old ones wanted to
get me more than ever. How they snarled!
How they circled and lashed their tails! They
couldn&rsquo;t get me; I had them. They were afraid.
Ten men on elephants, with rifles, they would
have attacked with a rush, but not me. They
were afraid.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, Johnny, they were wonderful cats.
Their coats! You have seen tigers in cages.
Bah! They are nothing to the great, free cats
of the jungle. The yellow! You have seen
the sky at sunset sometimes when it was painted
with golden fire? It was like that, only grander.
And the dark stripes! They were like midnight.
The gleam of their teeth, the burning red of
their eyes, as they prowled in the night. Ah!
Johnny! I had found true happiness. I only
wanted one thing to make me perfectly happy,
and that was to have them play with me, as they
played with their cubs; as the house cats played
with me when I was in rompers. That, too,
would have come, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sighing, Pant rose and began pacing the
beach again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A change came over me. I began to see
things and to wonder. At times I thought how
sick I had been down there in the little Dutch
mission hospital, and how the short, fat Dutch
nurses had pattered about in their wooden shoes
to help make me well. Then I saw the hundreds
and hundreds of poor natives who came limping
into our little station, or who were carried in
on bamboo stretchers. It all set me thinking.
Up to that time, I had thought that nothing
mattered but cats. I wanted to know all about
cats. I wanted, yes, I do believe I wanted to
be like a cat. Some folks believe we were all
animals once before we were born as humans.
An old native of the jungle told me that. If
that is true, then I was once a cat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I got to thinking that perhaps humans
counted more than the great cats in the jungle.
I didn&rsquo;t want to think that, not at first, but I
couldn&rsquo;t shake it off. When I went into the
jungle to watch the cats I saw in my mind those
sick people coming, coming, coming. I didn&rsquo;t
like it; didn&rsquo;t want to see them. There was yet
the great black cat. I must find him somewhere
in the jungle. I must see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day I talked to the doctor about my
thoughts, and he told me that people counted for
much more than big cats. He said he needed
medicine, supplies, new houses, everything, and
since I could go to the jungle and come back
alive, perhaps I could help him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a terrible thing he said: &lsquo;Go into
the jungle and get me tiger cubs. Traders will
pay big money for them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was terrible. I could do it. There were
three cubs. I could get them, but&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But,&rsquo; I said to the doctor, &lsquo;the big cats, the
father and mother, must first be killed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he smiled. And that was all he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went into the jungle again that night and,
as I watched the splendor of the great cats, I
said, &lsquo;No, I will never do it! Never! Never!&rsquo;
And yet I was going to do that very thing. I
was going to take a rifle with me, and lie there
in that wonderful moonlight to wait for them
to come back; sooner than I thought, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was that night, for the first time, that the
old tiger left his mate and the three cubs while
I watched them and went away to hunt by himself.
Then I was glad, for I always had wished
to watch him as he hunted down the blue deer,
the buffalo, wild goat or wild pig. So I followed.
Creeping after him through the moonlight
I lost him many times, for his yellow
stripes were like the moonbeams, and the dark
ones like wavering shadows. But I always
found him again, as he rose to leap along some
path or across an open spot in the forest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;At last I knew that we were nearing the
village. &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; I said to myself, &lsquo;so that is your
game. You will pick a calf or a fat young pig
for your dinner. Perhaps you may not fare as
well as that,&rsquo; for I decided that I must use my
charm to drive him from the village if he went
to rob there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, before I had expected it, he began to
circle. By that I knew he had scented some
prey. Narrower and narrower his circle grew.
Greater and greater became my curiosity, for I
wondered what kind of prey he could find so
near the village and yet not safe in its pen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally I climbed upon the trunk of a dead
tree, and then I saw. My blood ran cold. Out
of the village had wandered a child, a little girl
of four or five years. She had crept from her
bed while others were asleep, and there she was,
the pale moonlight glistening from her body,
and the tiger not four springs away. Then it
was that I saw, saw clear as midday how it was;
that all big cats were men&rsquo;s enemies, and were
but to be killed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yet, I could not kill. I had not as much as
a knife. I could do but one thing. I had my
charm. I must stand between the beast and the
child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three leaps brought me in his path. Then I
turned and faced him. It was a great and terrible
moment. My charm; would it work? He
was terribly angry. Lashing his tail, he leaped
to one side. But that was no good. I had him.
I was now beside the child, who was not one
bit afraid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That time the tiger almost dared. He leaped
once. Two more leaps remained. He leaped
again. I could see the round, black pupils of his
eyes; count his teeth; hear him breathe. Three
times they relaxed. He did not dare. My
charm; it worked. I had him. He did not dare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last he slunk away through the tall grass.
Then, because the child was not afraid, because
I knew it would be the last time I should ever
watch the cats and their cubs, I took the child
and followed the tiger back to the lair, where all
night long, beneath the moon, the tiger and his
mate with their cubs beat a hard, round path
about me and the little girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just before sunrise I heard the distant beat
of the tom tom, the bellowing of bull buffaloes.
Then it was that I knew that the natives were
driving the herd of buffaloes to the jungle that
they might frighten the tigers from their lair,
and secure the remains of the child. And all
the time I had the child safe in my arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant paused and looked away over the glimmering
water. The tom, tom, tom of the circus
drum was sounding. The indistinct noises
wafted on the breeze might be the lowing buffaloes.
Johnny, for the second, fancied himself
in the heart of the jungle with Pant, the
child, and the tigers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next night,&rdquo; Pant&rsquo;s voice had grown
suddenly husky, &ldquo;I went to the jungle again,
and that morning I brought in the pelts of the
tiger and his mate. The kittens were chained
to a tree. The natives brought them in later.
The hospital was bigger and better after that.
And I, I was a hero, a hero to them all, but not
to myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But the black cat, the panther?&rdquo; suggested
Johnny after a moment of silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, that was later. We have not time
for it now. We move to-night. We must
hurry. Already the people are leaving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing more before we go,&rdquo; said Johnny
eagerly. &ldquo;Light, Pant, does light travel in
straight lines?&rdquo; He was thinking of the crimson
flash that had leaped apparently from mid-air
in the tent the previous evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am surprised that you ask it,&rdquo; Pant smiled.
&ldquo;You have been in Alaska?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, at Cape Prince of Wales you must
have seen the midnight sun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in June.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the sun&rsquo;s rays shone straight, you must
have had then as many hours of continuous
darkness in December as you had of continuous
daylight in June. Did you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;We had three or four
hours of sun every day, even in December.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Pant, smiling, &ldquo;the sun&rsquo;s rays
must have been bent that they might reach you.
In fact, the rays of light never travel straight.
So long! I&rsquo;ll leave you now to think that over.
See you at our next stand. Hope I can tell you
then who has your diamond ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He vanished into the night, leaving Johnny to
stare after him in wonder and admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; Johnny said to himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
hear the story of the black leopard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br />CHAPTER XII
<br />JOHNNY WINS DOUBLE PAY</h2>
<p>Johnny had scarcely reached the cluster of
tents that loomed large in the darkness, when
he was startled by a sudden wild burst of activity.
Men and boys rushed silently here and
there; lanterns and searchlights flashed from
place to place. For a second he stood there paralyzed.
What was it, a fire or an approaching
cyclone?</p>
<p>Then he laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We move to-night. Down go the tents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did go down. Before his astonished
eyes they disappeared as if by magic. In all his
life he had never seen anything that came near
equaling the team work displayed in the dropping
of the big top and the loading of the circus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>In a marvelously short time they were on
their way. Johnny, because of his prospects of
becoming a regular performer, had been assigned
a berth in a sleeping car. Pant, being
merely a hanger-on, slept as he had on many
another night, beneath the stars, with only a
bale of canvas for covering.</p>
<p>Johnny spent a half hour in thought before
the even click, click of the wheels lulled him to
sleep. They were on their way, and he was
glad. To-morrow he would have his try-out.
To-morrow, too, he would give Gwen her second
lesson in boxing. Should he ask her about the
ring? To-morrow they would be in one of those
small cities in which Pant had said the counterfeiters
would reap their richest harvest. When
would Pant find his man? Would he, Johnny,
have a part in it? He must not fail to fulfill his
promise to Pant; to get acquainted with the
steam kettle cook and the midget clown.</p>
<p>The next morning Johnny kept his boxing
appointment with Gwen. It was after a half
hour of strenuous work, while they were resting
on a mat, that she turned to him suddenly and
said, in a low voice:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A strange thing happened last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was awakened from my sleep. I had been
dreaming of a fire, and I would have sworn that
it was a flash of red light that awakened me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s tone told nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is stranger still, two other girls were
awakened in the same manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had upper berths?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were glass ventilator windows above
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably the light from a switch tower shining
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was too bright for that. It was so bright
it was crimson. It was like&mdash;it was like the
crimson flash that fell on the tiger that other
night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That <i>was</i> strange,&rdquo; Johnny smiled, but his
smile told nothing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>He was not surprised when, as he met Pant a
half hour later, the strange fellow said to him
in a matter-of-fact tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the slim girl, the one that rides bareback,
Millie, what is it they call her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Millie Gonzales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the one. She&rsquo;s got your ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you might know,&rdquo; Johnny said
quietly.</p>
<p>Pant shot him a quick glance. &ldquo;Somebody
been talking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so you&rsquo;d need be alarmed. But, say,
now I know she&rsquo;s got it, how am I to get it from
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s up to you,&rdquo; retorted Pant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; said Johnny a little later; &ldquo;last
night I dreamed that the circus train was
wrecked, all shot to smithereens! And the animals&mdash;they
were having the time of their lives,
fighting each other and eating folks up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that ever happens,&rdquo; Pant gripped his arm
hard, &ldquo;if it ever does, you get that big black
cat! Get the black cat! See? He&rsquo;s a bad one;
a man-eater. Got a record. A bad one. See?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>Johnny nodded, and thought again of the story
Pant was to tell him of that same black cat and
the jungles of India. But there was no time for
it now; the show would soon begin, and then
would come the great event, his try-out.</p>
<p>It came. All too soon he found himself
marching down the sawdust trail. Dressed in
his tightly fitting green suit, and closely followed
by the bear, he felt foolish enough. He was a
trifle awed by the immense throng, too. He had
been in many a boxing match, but never one
like this. In those other matches he had had
men for opponents, and mostly men as spectators.
Here it was far different.</p>
<p>Anxious questions forced their way into his
consciousness. How was the boxing bout going?
Would he be able to manage the bear, or would
the animal, goaded on by the shouts of the
crowd, repeat the performance of that other day,
when he had run the Italian out of the tent?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>Cold perspiration stood out on Johnny&rsquo;s forehead,
yet he did not falter. Bracing himself for
his ordeal, he bowed low to the audience, then
turned to put the bear through his preliminary
antics. All went well; still, through it all, Johnny&rsquo;s
eyes strayed now and then to the boxing
gloves. So real was his fear of the outcome of
the match, that at times it seemed to him the
gloves were alive and ready to leap from the
floor into his face.</p>
<p>Yet, when the time came, the thing seemed as
simple as child&rsquo;s play. The bear performed his
part perfectly. Johnny even risked a little extra
exhibition by entering into a clinch with the
bear and cleverly extricating himself. The great
test came, however, when the bear, appearing to
grow angry, leaped squarely at him. Three
times the great beast did this, then with a sudden
cry of seeming terror, Johnny darted from
the ring and, closely followed by the bear, raced
away before the packed throng of amazed and
delighted spectators. When the bear paused,
threw his gloves and turned to leer at the audience,
Johnny knew that he had not only made
good, but made good <i>big</i>. He had won his
double pay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>He was just rounding the outer entrance, with
the applause of the crowd dying away, when a
small, shrill voice squeaked up to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did fine. You&rsquo;re all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glancing down, Johnny had no difficulty in
recognizing Tom Stick, the midget clown. He
cut a comical figure as he stood there. A mere
child in size, he was dressed in an African hunting
suit and carried a shiny air rifle. Not far
away, a gigantic elephant stood complacently
stuffing hay into his mouth.</p>
<p>Johnny looked first at the midget, then at the
elephant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We go on next,&rdquo; squeaked the little fellow,
&ldquo;Jo-Jo, that&rsquo;s the elephant, and myself. I play
I&rsquo;m hunting wild elephants. See? Shoot him.
See? Shoot him with the air gun all around the
tent. Real bullets, too! He doesn&rsquo;t mind.
Hide&rsquo;s tough. We always get a laugh; Jo-Jo
and I do. Want to know how we came to be
friends, Jo-Jo and me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, Jo-Jo was a French elephant.
They didn&rsquo;t need him during the war, so they
sent him over to America, and sold him here.
Well, Jo-Jo knew French all right, but he didn&rsquo;t
understand a word of English. He was supposed
to be one of the smartest elephants in the
world over in France, but over here he was so
stupid they actually had to push him off the cars
when they unloaded him. Just plumb stupid.
See? Got so they wished they didn&rsquo;t have him
at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know, I used to show in France
once myself, so I knew a little French, and one
day, just for fun, I said to Jo-Jo:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bon jour, Jo-Jo. Comment alle vous!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, that elephant nearly wiggled his
old palm leaf ears off out of pure joy. I knew
right away what made it; it was hearin&rsquo; someone
speak in his own language, so I just went
right on spielin&rsquo; French to him, and he kept on
gettin&rsquo; happier and happier until at last I had to
stop for fear he&rsquo;d break a blood vessel laughin&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the Boss knew about it, he gave Jo-Jo
to me, and we&rsquo;ve been mates ever since.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to be movin&rsquo; up. Good-by, Mr.
Bear Boxer. See you some other time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny watched the dwarf, as he walked behind
the elephant and, turning a corner, disappeared
from sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s one of the fellows Pant suspects
of being the forger, Black McCree? Not the
man, I&rsquo;d say,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;And yet, you
never can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the next morning, while he was preparing
for his daily bout with Gwen, that Johnny
received a shock of surprise which he did not
soon forget.</p>
<p>A unique plan for creating a new laugh had
occurred to him. He was telling it to Gwen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t have the clown assist you in
your turn, do they?&rdquo; He smiled, as he laced
her right glove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. How could they? I never saw a clown
walk the tight wire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t need to; just pretend to.&rdquo; He
stooped to pick up her left glove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, they might have two or three
small balloons just large enough to lift him off
the ground. They could have small ropes attached
to each of these. The attendants&mdash;the&mdash;the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s eyes had seen something which made
him stutter. On the plump third finger of
Gwen&rsquo;s left hand reposed <i>the</i> ring, the diamond
ring, which had been the means of making him a
circus performer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take it off for you.&rdquo; He drew the
ring from her finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; she smiled at him. &ldquo;Awfully
stupid of me to wear it. There&rsquo;s a handkerchief
in the right hand pocket of my blouse. Just
wrap it in that, and put it in my pocket, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For one brief second Johnny hesitated. Was
this the moment of moments? The ring which
would clear his good name was within his grasp.
Should he say, &ldquo;Gwen, this belongs to a friend
of mine, not to you; I must take it to her&rdquo;?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>For an instant he looked into Gwen&rsquo;s frank
blue eyes, then, without a word, he drew the
handkerchief from her pocket, wrapped the ring
carefully up, then thrust it deep down in the
pocket of her blouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was about to say,&rdquo; he continued with
forced composure, &ldquo;they could hold the balloons
steady, while the clown tripped lightly
along the wire. Perhaps he might even attempt
a clog. When he was in the midst of the clog,
the attendants could suddenly lose control of the
balloons, letting the clown go up to the top of
the tent. He could then climb to earth head first
by doing a hand-over-hand on a rope fastened
to a peg in the ground. Don&rsquo;t you think that
would bring a laugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gwen&rsquo;s brow was wrinkled in thought for a
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think it would,&rdquo; she said suddenly.
&ldquo;I think it would be a berry! How&rsquo;d you like to
be the clown?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t in aviation in the Army,&rdquo; smiled
Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but really, would you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why! Why! Yes, I might. It might be
better than boxing the bear, and since I&rsquo;ve got to
stick around, I might as well be a clown as anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stick around?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Why do you
have to stick around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant the words were on the tip of
Johnny&rsquo;s tongue which would have told her the
whole truth. But his lips would not frame the
sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&mdash;I,&rdquo; he stammered; &ldquo;just my nature,
I guess. Always did like the circus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny was not a great success as a boxer
that morning. He was thinking of the diamond
ring, and wondering why he had not demanded
the right to keep it, once he had it in his grasp;
wondering, too, how it happened that Millie had
it one day, and Gwen another. &ldquo;Queer mixup,&rdquo;
was his mental comment.</p>
<p>Late that night, after the show was over,
when the lights were dim, Johnny wandered into
the animal tent. He was just passing the cage
of the black leopard when a low hiss halted him.
Then he felt a grip on his arm. It was Pant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down here in the dark, Johnny,&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you the story of that black
beast. I can tell it better with his wicked red
eyes burning holes at me through the dark, just
as they did once before, and him a free black
cat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny started as he stared at the cage where,
on a narrow wooden shelf, the leopard must be
reposing. All he could see was a pair of red
balls of fire, and it seemed to him that in all his
life he had never seen anything so full of hate
as was the red gleam that seemed fairly to shoot
out from them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><br />CHAPTER XIII
<br />PANT&rsquo;S STORY OF THE BLACK CAT</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Life&rsquo;s like this,&rdquo; Pant gripped Johnny&rsquo;s arm,
as the two red balls in the back of the dark cage
shifted from side to side; &ldquo;life&rsquo;s just like this:
When once you&rsquo;ve done a thing, you want to do
it again. That&rsquo;s why we have to watch our
habits, if we want our lives to count for something.
Lots of fellows don&rsquo;t watch them. I told
you about killing the old tiger and his mate, and
bringing in the cubs to the doctor, so he could
sell them to the traders and buy supplies for his
hospital. Well, once I had done that, I wanted
to do it again. I guess there was something of
my old desire to study cats in me yet, for I was
overjoyed when I heard wild stories about a
giant black leopard that haunted the trail far up
the river. You see, the mountain streams were
drying up, and the big cats were being driven
out of the mountain forests to the river jungles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The stories they told about that big black
cat made a fellow&rsquo;s blood run cold. He was big
as a tiger. He was a fierce man-eater. His
fangs were twice the size of a tiger&rsquo;s, and each
one like a knife blade. He had been seen to
seize a full grown man, and before the man&rsquo;s
companions could fire upon him, to leap to the
bough of a tree, ten feet from the ground, the
man in his jaws, too. The others had fled in
terror. They never knew what terrible fate had
overtaken their companion until a few days later
a second party passing that way had found his
bones strewn beneath that tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I laughed at their stories. A
black cat do a thing like that? Why, the one
in the zoo back home was not three times the
size of a house cat, and he, the keeper had told
me, was eight years old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not believe their stories, but the natives
believed them, and would not stir up the river
road; and none would come down it, either; so
those who were sick could not come to the hospital
I had helped to make better. This made
me angry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will go and kill that black cat,&rsquo; I said to
the doctor. &lsquo;I will have his skin for a foot mat!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He smiled in a friendly way, and bade me
not be rash. The black leopard, he told me, was
much more to be feared than the tiger. Unlike
the tiger, he killed for the fun of killing. He
climbed trees, and there on the dark trunk, seeming
but a part of the tree itself, he waited for
his prey. In the gloom of the forest, he dropped
without a sound, and his attack was most terrible.
He was truly large, too, six feet in length
from tip of nose to base of tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not believe the doctor. Had I not seen
a full grown black leopard in the zoo? Was he
not an insignificant fellow? And yet, I was a
little afraid, for I remembered that the black cat
in the zoo had not been afraid, when all the
other great cats cringed in dark corners of their
cages. I was a little afraid, but I would not
admit it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Just because you have told me he is terrible,&rsquo;
I said, &lsquo;I will take along a strong cage. I
will bring him to you alive. We will sell him to
the traders, and buy more beds for our hospital.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the doctor begged me not to be foolhardy.
But I would not listen. With four natives
to carry the cage, with a rifle in my hand,
and a big knife at my belt, I went&mdash;went far up
the river trail. When the natives would go no
farther, I called them dirty cowards, and putting
my rifle inside the cage, dragged the cage
after me until I had come to a place where, in
a deep forest, at the bend of the river, the black
cat was said to make his stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was frightened a little, Johnny, when I saw
the bleached bones of a man lying beneath a
great tree where mosses and vines hung thick,
but I reassured myself by saying the man had
died there alone, and the jackals had picked his
bones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the origin of the wild story,&rsquo; I told
myself. &lsquo;Like as not there is no black cat at all,
and I shall go home disappointed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t, Johnny, I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>Johnny could feel Pant&rsquo;s hand grip his arm
hard, as the black creature in the cage stirred
and gave forth a sort of hissing yawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were never in the jungle at night?&rdquo;
Pant&rsquo;s tense, vibrant whisper told more plainly
than words that he was living over again those
hours in the jungle alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; breathed Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful, and terrible. The sun sinks
from sight. Darkness comes and then out shines
the moon. And the moonlight! Nowhere else
is it like it is in the jungle. It creeps down
among the masses of leaves, transforming
swinging, swaying limbs into gigantic, twisting
serpents, ready at any moment to swing down
upon you. It turns every shadow-dotted tree
trunk into a beast ready to leap at your throat.
It&rsquo;s weird, fascinating, terrible. Down at the
river some beast plunges into the water. You
hear the splash, then the swish, swish of his
strokes. He is coming to your bank, you are
sure. You are afraid. Who would not be?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But me, I sat by my cage, with the rifle over
one knee and watched. One hour, two hours,
three hours I watched, until at last all the twisting
branches, the spotted tree trunks were familiar
to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, then he came; the black beast, the
great black cat, he came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant paused. There came a hiss from the
cage, as if the black cat, too, was living those
hours over again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him, Johnny, I saw him. I caught the
wicked gleam of his two red eyes.&rdquo; Pant gripped
Johnny&rsquo;s arm until it hurt. &ldquo;He was not thirty
feet from me. Flattened against a broad tree
trunk, he was glaring at me out of the dark.
How he came so close without my seeing him, I
cannot tell. He was a devil. Perhaps he had
been there all that time. Who knows?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, there he was. I cast my charm
upon him. And I had him, Johnny, I had him.
With my rifle I could have shot him on the
instant. But he had me, too. He was so wonderful.
I have told you about the wonder of the
tiger&rsquo;s coat. It is nothing to the coat of a black
leopard in the jungle. You have seen him. You
know how immense he is; seven feet from tip
of nose to base of tail. You have seen him in
his cage, but will never see him as I saw him
that night, a free beast in his own wilderness,
and I a stranger, an intruder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought I had him. I wanted to study
him: to learn his secrets. I planned how I would
follow him day after day, and learn all his
secrets. I was mad, stark mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant paused again as if for breath. The black
beast moved nearer on his shelf within the cage.
The thrashing of his tail was like the dull beat
of a drum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just when I was thinking all this,&rdquo; Pant rose
upon his knees in his excitement, &ldquo;just when I
thought I had him, he gave one piercing scream
and leaped. My man, what a leap! He struck
me all unprepared; struck me with fangs and
claws tearing at my flesh. Yet my right hand
was free. It was a tense, agonizing second. In
some way I got out my knife and slashed away
with it. The next instant I lost consciousness.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>Pant paused again. Once more the leopard
moved his length along the cage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Johnny, here&rsquo;s the strangest part of all.
I cannot explain it; only know it&rsquo;s true. They
say that sometimes, in moments of great shock,
men lose their personality and become another
person; that when they come back to themselves
they have done things they know nothing of,
yet others have seen them do. It may have been
like that with me. And then, a great teacher in
the heart of India once told me that there was a
great spirit of the forest who looked after brave
hunters, and did things for them in time of
great danger which they could not do for themselves.
It may have been that, too. Whatever
way it may have been, it was strange; so strange
that you would not believe me were I not your
friend who always told you the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Johnny! When I came to myself I
was weak, terribly weak from loss of blood; but
the cat, the big black cat, he was raging in the
cage, and the door was fastened tight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>Pant paused. The animal tent was still. Suddenly
a crimson flash gleamed. For an instant
it turned the black cat blood red. The next moment,
with a wild snarl, the beast flattened himself
against the bars of his cage.</p>
<p>A keeper sprang out of the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s what?&rdquo; drawled Pant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I saw a flash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He evidently thought something of the
sort,&rdquo; Pant replied, poking his thumb at the
black cat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you guys better move on. This ain&rsquo;t
no place for spinnin&rsquo; yarns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; drawled Pant, &ldquo;but let me
tell you, friend; if anything ever happens to this
circus, a fire, a cyclone, a train wreck, or anything
like that, you get that cat. Get that black
cat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you know about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty that I don&rsquo;t tell to strangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant lifted the wall of the tent and stepped
out into the moonlight, followed by Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t finish,&rdquo; suggested Johnny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much more to tell. You have to
hand it to that doctor, though. When I didn&rsquo;t
come back in the morning, he tried to organize a
party to search for me. No one would go.
They were scared cold by the black cat. So he
came alone. He found me there, too weak to
move, and he carried me all the way back and
put me in a bed I&rsquo;d helped him to buy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The natives went for the black cat and
brought him back to the village in triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was better a trader came to me and
offered me the price of a tiger&rsquo;s cub for the
black cat. I laughed in his face, and told him
I&rsquo;d take the cat to the States myself. That&rsquo;s
what I did. I got five thousand dollars for him,
and sent it all back to the doctor so he could
buy beds, and absorbent cotton, and medicine
for his hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was good of you,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s good?&rdquo; demanded Pant. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he
teach me sense when I didn&rsquo;t know anything but
cats? Didn&rsquo;t he carry me out of the jungle on
his back when no one else dared to go in?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>For a time they were silent. Then, gripping
Johnny&rsquo;s arm, Pant whispered: &ldquo;But, Johnny,
we&rsquo;re after worse cats than the black one.
We&rsquo;re after human tigers. Tigers that destroy
man&rsquo;s faith in man; that make life little worth
the living. And, Johnny, we&rsquo;re on their trail,
close on their trail. Perhaps to-morrow, perhaps
the day after, you shall see&mdash;well, you shall see
what you shall see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><br />CHAPTER XIV
<br />IN TOM STICK&rsquo;S HOUSE</h2>
<p>That same night, by the dull glow of a half
burned out camp fire on the bank of a river,
Pant told Johnny of his plans as a Secret Service
man on a big case, and how they had worked
out thus far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember the crimson flash in the animal
tent, and how it frightened a lot of the colored
boys into jumping their jobs?&rdquo; he chuckled.
&ldquo;Well, that helped me, helped me a lot; for you
see some of the boys that quit were working for
this bunch of counterfeiters that has Black
McCree as its head. Some of the boys that were
hired were already getting pay from Uncle Sam
for helping me. Some of them now are getting
triple pay, once from the circus, once from
me and once from the counterfeiters. See how
it works?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>Pant chuckled again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These boys with the three pay checks have
helped me a lot, but not enough. They can&rsquo;t get
back far enough. They know only the men who
pass the bonds on to them, and those men are
just helpers like themselves. They pass the
goods on, but the real man is still back in the
shadows; too far back for me to see him. He&rsquo;s
the man I want; the man and his outfit; and let
me tell you, Johnny, that&rsquo;s some outfit. There&rsquo;s
never been anything like it before. It&rsquo;s a danger.
Where and when they operate is more than
I know. They could hardly do it in one of the
tents. They might do it in one of the cars,
and it might be Tom, the midget clown, doing it
in his house on wheels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve talked with him,&rdquo; said Johnny quickly.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s in on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure. Take no chances. If
he&rsquo;s especially friendly, that may mean that he
is onto the fact that you&rsquo;re working with me and
that I&rsquo;m after them. A bunch like that would
stab you in the back in a second.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>For a few minutes there was silence, then
Pant continued: &ldquo;We are making some progress.
We know about how much of the &lsquo;queer&rsquo;
they are peddling in these towns, and take my
word, it&rsquo;s a plenty. They are planting it thick.
We&rsquo;ve got to get &rsquo;em, and get &rsquo;em quick. Have
you talked with Andy McQueen, the steam kettle
cook, yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do it to-morrow. He may be important.
And Johnny,&rdquo; Pant leaned forward with an
impressive gesture, &ldquo;Johnny, watch your step.
You&rsquo;re in danger every moment. They may
know you&rsquo;re with me; probably do, and if they
do, they&rsquo;ll get you if they can. That&rsquo;s all. Goodnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rising, he stretched himself like a cat, then
went slouching away into the darkness.</p>
<p>For a long time Johnny lay there on the sand
dreamily gazing into the fire. It was, indeed, a
tangled web of mystery the unraveling of
which he had let himself in for, and one which,
as Pant had suggested, might at any moment
suddenly break and let him down with an awful
fall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>There was the ring. Gwen had it that morning;
Millie had it two days before; perhaps
Mitzi had it at this very moment. He was still
surprised at himself because of his action of
that morning. Well, he must have that ring.
This, if for no other reason, must hold him to his
surprising circus career. He wondered if Gwen
were serious about the clown stunt and, if so,
whether she would soon have it arranged. He
thought again of Pant&rsquo;s problem, and wondered
for the hundredth time if he should have any
part in its solving.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>But the greatest mystery of all was the crimson
flash. He had seen it leap down from the
air and turn the tiger, loose in the big tent,
blood red. He had seen it do the same thing in
the animal tent. In his suggestion regarding
the direction of the sun&rsquo;s rays in the Arctic,
Pant had intimated that rays of light could be
made to follow crooked paths. If this could be
done, if Pant held within his fertile brain the
secret of this terrible power, what a wonderful
fellow he was! How it would transform modern
life, modern warfare! Trenches would be
utterly useless once a light might be thrown
upon them from any angle. Many things that
were dark, secret and hidden in every day life
would be clear as the light of day. What dark
corner, what secret rendezvous, would be safe
from the glare of those crooked rays of gleaming
light?</p>
<p>Johnny pondered until his head whirled, then,
rising and shaking himself, he made his way to
the sleeping car in which he now bunked. The
circus would soon be on its way to the next
small city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>That next small city, if Johnny had but known
it, was only ten miles from the home of the
grandparents of the millionaire twins. They
had ridden cross country for a visit to their
grandparents. Along the roads they had seen
glaring posters announcing the coming of the
circus. They had decided at once that now was
the time to join that circus. Their circus riding
clothes were in the trunk, which had been sent
on by express. Even as Johnny rose from beside
the fire, the twins, in their beds at their
grandfather&rsquo;s rambling, old house, were planning
how, on the morrow, they would slip on
their circus garb underneath their dresses, and
ride away to discover their old friend, Johnny,
and join the parade.</p>
<p>Morning broke bright and clear on the old
fair grounds of Rokford, which was the place
of the great circus&rsquo; next one day stand. When
Johnny had eaten breakfast, he strolled past the
cooking tent and, having paused to admire the
row of shining copper steam kettles, he thought
of his promise to get in touch with the manager
of these kettles. The cook was not in sight at
that moment, so Johnny paused to study these
great vats, which resembled nothing so much as
giant kettle drums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a twist of the valve and the steam does
the rest,&rdquo; he murmured to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great, ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; a voice said at his elbow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure are.&rdquo; Johnny turned about. It was
the cook. A tall, slender man, well past middle
age, with a drooping mustache, and a wrinkled
smile, he studied Johnny from head to toe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a boxer,&rdquo; he said, getting his smile
into operation. &ldquo;Saw you box a conman once.
Been wonderin&rsquo; ever since how such a small
fellow could pack such a wallop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind tellin&rsquo; you,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
absurdly simple. Instead of just getting the
force of your arm muscles into the blow, or the
push of your shoulder, you leap as you strike,
and that puts the whole of your body back of
your mitt. That&rsquo;s easy, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is, after you been doin&rsquo; it a few
thousand times; easy as fryin&rsquo; flapjacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you been cooking with steam
kettles?&rdquo; asked Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only five or six years. But I&rsquo;ve been cookin&rsquo;
all my life. I was cook for a surveying outfit
when the Union Pacific was built. Boy! Those
were the days of real sport. Used to run out of
fuel and everything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>A humorous twinkle lurked about the man&rsquo;s
eyes, as he lighted his pipe and sat down on an
upturned bucket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mind one time,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;when we was
plumb out of wood, and nothin&rsquo; but grass;
prairie all &rsquo;round us. Just enough fire to make
coffee; not enough to fry flapjacks, and the nearest
supply station thirty miles away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; asked Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; the cook removed his pipe and
spat on the ground, &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Boys, there&rsquo;ll be
flapjacks for breakfast just the same.&rsquo; I mixed
&rsquo;em up as usual in a big tin bucket. I gave the
bucket to one of the boys, and a hunk of bacon
rind to another, and told &rsquo;em all to follow me.
I struck a match and set the prairie grass on
fire; then I held my fryin&rsquo; pan over it until it
was hot. I baked the first flapjack and tossed
it out of the pan over my shoulder. Some fellow
caught and ate it. I did another and another
the same way, and kept that up until every
fellow in the bunch was satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>Johnny smiled. The cook smiled, spat on the
ground, then concluded his story. &ldquo;When we
got through breakfast we were ten miles from
camp. Prairie fire travels. So did we.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny laughed; then he thought and laughed
again. After a time he rose and went on his
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s another fellow,&rdquo; he told himself,
&ldquo;that I&rsquo;d never suspect of being a crook, but
what&rsquo;s that about people who &lsquo;smile and smile
and are a villain still&rsquo;? A fellow has to watch
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was just thinking of this when a shrill
voice piped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Johnny! Want to see my house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Tom Stick, the midget clown. He was
offering Johnny a rare privilege; inviting him to
view the inside of his house on wheels. Pant
had told Johnny that such a boon had been
granted to no one. Yet, because it was so rare,
and because of Pant&rsquo;s warning, &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll stab
you in the back,&rdquo; he was tempted for a second
to decline.</p>
<p>Courage and curiosity overcame his fears, and
smiling he said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Lead the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clown&rsquo;s house was little more than a box
on wheels, but once Johnny had crowded himself
through the narrow door and seated himself,
much humped up, on a miniature chair, he
was surprised at the completeness of its furnishings.
He could easily imagine himself in a
hunter&rsquo;s lodge in the depths of the forest. An
open fireplace, with a real wood fire burning, a
roughly hewn table, benches beside the fireplace,
a cluster of fox skins hanging in the corner, a
bear skin on the floor, rifles hanging on one
wall; all these, with the unmistakable odor of
fresh pine wood, went far toward taking him
back to the forests.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; squeaked Tom Stick, rubbing his
hands in delight at Johnny&rsquo;s astonishment, &ldquo;I
was born and brought up in the Maine woods.
I loved the wild out-of-doors, and when the circus
people offered me big money to join them,
I told them no. But my mother needed the
money, so, at last, I told them if they&rsquo;d build me
this house, and never disturb me in it, I&rsquo;d come.
You see they did. I&rsquo;ve never had any of the
other circus people in here. Didn&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d
understand. They&rsquo;ve always lived in a tent.
They&rsquo;d laugh at a fellow who wanted a home
with four board walls, a ceiling, and a smell of
the pine woods in it. But I knew you wouldn&rsquo;t.
You&rsquo;ve had a home, and you know the woods.
Tell that by the color in your cheeks, and the
way you swing your arms when you walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the dwarf was silent, then suddenly
he shot a question at his visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, what do you live for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, why, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Johnny stammered.
&ldquo;Just live because it&rsquo;s fun to live, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The midget wrinkled his small brow in
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so bad,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Not so bad.
But Johnny; did you ever wonder what a little
fellow like me lives for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Johnny admitted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s a lot of things we can&rsquo;t do that
big folks can; but there&rsquo;s one thing, Johnny, one
thing,&rdquo; Tom&rsquo;s tone died to a whisper; &ldquo;a short
man can have a tall bank account. He can,
can&rsquo;t he, Johnny?&rdquo; The little fellow twisted
his face into a knowing smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he can,&rdquo; grinned Johnny, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s
a fine thing that he can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny had stepped over and was examining
an ancient squirrel rifle, which Tom explained
had belonged to his grandfather, when he noticed
the way the walls of the house were fastened.
The walls were made of fresh pine slabs.
They were wired tight to something behind
them. &ldquo;Iron bars,&rdquo; was his mental comment.
&ldquo;When they made this they just built it inside
a wild animal cage. I wonder what would happen
if a fellow were to get locked in here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was speculating on this, when he heard a
voice outside calling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, Johnny Thompson!&rdquo; It was Gwen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>He answered the call and, turning to his little
host, said: &ldquo;Guess I better go. Some work, I
suppose. Great little house, you&rsquo;ve got. Much
obliged for letting me see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He backed out of the door and hurried away
to join Gwen, but even as he did so, he thought
of the midget clown&rsquo;s reference to a tall bank
account, and of his house built inside a cage.
What if this little fellow was a miser? What if
his greed for gold had led him into counterfeiting?
What if he were Black McCree? What
safer place could be found for hiding a counterfeiter&rsquo;s
den than a house built inside a cage on
wheels?</p>
<p>All these speculations were cut short by the
appearance of the smiling face of his lady boxing
partner, Gwen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the clown stunt,&rdquo; she exclaimed excitedly.
&ldquo;The big chief fell for it right away. He
hurried a messenger off to Chicago for the balloons.
They&rsquo;re already here, and they&rsquo;ve tried
them out with a dummy and they worked beautifully.
They want you to try it right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This dummy,&rdquo; smiled Johnny, &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t
fall and break his neck, did he?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not, Silly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s hoping I don&rsquo;t, but it&rsquo;s a powerful
long distance from the top of the center tent
pole down to the sawdust.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><br />CHAPTER XV
<br />BURSTING BALLOONS</h2>
<p>The big top had never been more crowded
than it was the night of Johnny&rsquo;s first performance
as a clown. And never, in the memory of
the oldest circus man, had there been a jollier
throng. Never had there been an act more
thoroughly appreciated than that of Gwen, the
Queen, and Johnny, the fat clown.</p>
<p>Johnny had been dressed in inflated rubber
clothing until he appeared as fat as a butcher.
When, by the aid of the balloons, he rose to the
tight wire, when he tripped lightly along it, and
returned cakewalking, the spectators howled
their approval. But when in apparent consternation,
he lost his step and instead of plunging
downward, leaped upward with the sudden lift
of the balloons, they rose to their feet and roared
their delight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>Silently, calmly, he rose toward the tent top.
There was nothing calm about the feelings that
surged in Johnny&rsquo;s breast, however. He had
never been in aviation, and never would be.
Going up in the air made him feel sick. Had it
not been for Gwen, he would have refused to
attempt this stunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well!&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the top; now I
can grab the rope and come down. Rope&rsquo;s more
certain than these balloons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly had the thought passed through his
brain than there came a loud report. So close it
was that it hurt his ear drums. It was followed
almost instantly by a second explosion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The balloons,&rdquo; Johnny groaned. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
bursting!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>For a second his head whirled. To drop from
those dizzy heights meant death. Then his mind
cleared. The rope was to his right. Already he
was beginning to shoot downward. Could he
reach it? With one wild leap in mid-air, he
thrust out a hand. He grasped the rope with
his left, then lost his hold. With his right, he
secured a firmer grip. At that same instant the
last balloon burst. For one sickening moment,
he clung there, swinging backward and forward,
madly groping for the rope with his free hand.
At last, he found it, and, with a sigh of relief,
began sliding down the rope.</p>
<p>The crowd was standing up cheering. The
band was playing. Even the performers thought
it part of the act.</p>
<p>For a minute or two after he had reached the
ground, Johnny rested on a mat. As he rose to
go he noticed something lying in the sawdust.
Carelessly he picked it up, examined it, then gave
a low whistle. It was an arrow-like affair. The
shaft was of steel wire, the head of wood. The
head had been discolored, part yellow and part
dark brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sulphur!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Dipped in burning
sulphur, then shot at my balloons! No wonder
they exploded. Now, who played that dirty
trick?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>He examined the thing carefully. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t
have been shot from a bow, no groove for the
bow string. Now I wonder. An air rifle, that&rsquo;s
what it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly there flashed before his mind a picture
of a midget clown chasing a huge elephant
around the ring. The clown was dressed in equatorial
hunting garb and carried an air rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Stick!&rdquo; Johnny murmured. &ldquo;Tom
Stick and his air rifle! I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought
he&rsquo;d do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly he walked back through the alleyway
that led to the dressing room.</p>
<p>He had discarded his clown suit and had
walked out into the open air, when a shrill
young voice called his name:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, Johnny Thompson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whirling about, he found himself facing the
millionaire twins. They were riding astride their
ponies, and were dressed as if ready for their
turn in the ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;where&rsquo;d you come from, and who let
you in?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came from our grandfather&rsquo;s to join the
circus,&rdquo; piped Marjory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and to think,&rdquo; Margaret fairly wailed,
&ldquo;we got here too late for the parade!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny looked at them for a moment, then
laughed a good natured laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got let down, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he smiled.
&ldquo;Well, so did I a minute ago, mighty sudden,
too. But perhaps we can get you into a part
yet, since this is positively your first and last
appearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Johnny,&rdquo; exclaimed Marjory, &ldquo;not
the last! We&rsquo;ve come to stay as long as you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t stay long,&rdquo; laughed Johnny.
&ldquo;Circus is no place for millionaire twins. You
wait right here. I&rsquo;ll be back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By dint of much persuading, Johnny succeeded
in getting the twins a place on the program.
At the end of the races came a pony
race. The ponies were ridden by monkeys. It
was arranged that the two little girls, on their
own ponies, were to race the monkeys on their
circus mounts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>It was a wilder and more genuine race than
is usually pulled off in the circus, for the twins
were dead in earnest about winning it, and so
were the monkeys. The monkeys and their
ponies had played at racing so long, however,
they were not able to get seriously down to
business. When the twins were riding neck and
neck, three lengths ahead of their nearest rivals,
they delighted the throng by leaping upon their
feet and riding in this manner around the last
sweeping circle and out of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; exclaimed the manager, rubbing
his hands. &ldquo;Who are they, friends of
yours? Can we book &rsquo;em for the rest of the
season?&rdquo; He was speaking to Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t book them for another show,&rdquo; groaned
Johnny. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll get skinned alive for letting
them in on this one. They&rsquo;re the daughters of
Major MacDonald, the steel magnate. Ran
away from their grandfather&rsquo;s, and they go back
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The manager whistled. &ldquo;Too bad to spoil
perfectly good circus girls to make society
belles,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;But seein&rsquo; that&rsquo;s who they
are, I guess it can&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oow-wee! That was grand!&rdquo; exclaimed
Marjory, who now came up with her sister.
&ldquo;Did we make good. Can we stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You made good, but you can&rsquo;t stay,&rdquo; smiled
Johnny. &ldquo;What do you suppose your grandparents
are thinking of about now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they won&rsquo;t know about it at all. We
are supposed to be over here with friends who
live down on Pine street. That&rsquo;s how they let
us come at all. These friends are real old folks
and don&rsquo;t go to circuses. When we got here,
we called them up as if we were at home and
told them we couldn&rsquo;t come; so you see it&rsquo;s all
right. And, Johnny, if we can&rsquo;t stay and be
circus folks, we can stay just one night, can&rsquo;t
we, and have a real ride in a circus train?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny looked at the manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; grinned the good natured boss of the
circus. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put you in the care of Ma Kelly,
the circus girls&rsquo; matron, and you&rsquo;ll be safe as a
bean in a bowl of soup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far do we move?&rdquo; asked Johnny, a bit
anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only forty miles, and that leaves us less
than thirty miles from their grandfather&rsquo;s place.
They can make it back all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll borrow one of the rough riders&rsquo; ponies,
and hoof it back with them,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;But
remember,&rdquo; he turned to the twins, &ldquo;remember,
this is the last. To-morrow morning you turn
your faces toward home. And by thunder! I
wish I could go along to stay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Why can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; cried Marjory.
&ldquo;We want you to. Indeed, we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you now. Maybe some time.
You stay right here. I&rsquo;ll send Ma Kelly around.
Then I&rsquo;ve got to go box the bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny rushed away, and that was the last
they saw of him for some time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><br />CHAPTER XVI
<br />THE WRECK OF THE CIRCUS</h2>
<p>That night, as Johnny listened to the chant
of the negroes as they went about their tasks of
breaking camp and loading, he fancied that
there was a weird and restless tone to it, foretelling
some catastrophe brooding over all.</p>
<p>The night was dark, with black, rainless
clouds hurrying across the sky. Johnny shivered
as he walked toward his sleeping car. His
hand was on the rail when someone touched his
arm. It was Pant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;how&rsquo;d you like to
ride with me in the gondola to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; Johnny answered, a note of
impatience in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s going to be a bother, don&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come along.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thought you might like to be in on something
big.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in on something big twice to-day.
The first came near to being my funeral, and
the second will be, if I don&rsquo;t get those twins
back to their grandfather&rsquo;s pretty quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny told Pant of the day&rsquo;s experiences, as
they made their way back to a tent car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll come out all right with the twins,&rdquo;
said Pant. &ldquo;I only hope we don&rsquo;t get into
things that&rsquo;ll muss us up to-night, but we&rsquo;ll go
careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he whispered, as they settled
down among the piles of canvas, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s that Liberty
bond business. I&rsquo;ve been scouting &rsquo;round
in the towns we&rsquo;ve been in, and the way they&rsquo;ve
been spreading the &lsquo;queer&rsquo; about is nothing short
of a super-crime.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been running up a blind trail for a long
time. Thought I had something on that conman
with the ragged ear and two of his pals.
I followed them down to the river in Chicago
twice, and the second time came near catching
them; would have, too, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for a
rat that tried to eat my hand off. I got &rsquo;em the
other night&mdash;outfit and everything, and it
turned out to be only a mimeograph kit for making
fake telegrams, announcing results of
races, baseball games, and the like. I was sore
when I found it was nothing; might have been
a blind, at that. But I had to start all over
again, and last night when we were on the way,
I made a mighty important discovery. There
was a light in the rear end of one of the horse
cars most of the night. That&rsquo;s as far as I got.
It was moonlight. They might see me if I came
spying around. Besides, I wanted someone else
along; someone with a strong arm. Didn&rsquo;t want
to get pitched off the train just when I had my
hand on the trick. Of course, it may be just an
all night crap game, but I don&rsquo;t think so. Anyway,
we&rsquo;ll see. We&rsquo;ll let them get under way,
then when we&rsquo;re clipping it up at a lively rate,
and the moon&rsquo;s under, we&rsquo;ll have a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant fell silent, apparently lost in his intricate
problem. Johnny yawned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>A quarter of an hour later Johnny was just
dropping off into a doze, when Pant gripped his
arm and whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon. Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having climbed over two gondolas and the
top of a one-time express car, they dropped cat-like
from the roof of the express car to the
platform of a second express car.</p>
<p>Here they stood silent, listening for fully two
minutes. At first everything appeared dark, but
presently Johnny caught a faint gleam of light
that apparently came through a crack in a lower
panel of the express car door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do if they come out at us. It&rsquo;s
a rotten place,&rdquo; he whispered. Just then the car
gave a lurch which almost threw him from the
narrow platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Duck and jump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty risky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only chance. Too many of &rsquo;em. Probably
guns and everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Get busy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>Pant dropped on his knee and, bracing himself
to avoid being thrown against the door by
a sudden lurch, peered through the crack.</p>
<p>What he saw drew forth a whispered exclamation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the real gang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time all was silent. Johnny&rsquo;s heart
was doing time and a half. What if they were
forced to stand and fight or jump? He shivered
as he tried to make out the embankment through
the darkness. They were racing down grade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em! It&rsquo;s the gang!&rdquo; Pant whispered
again. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose and stepped aside. With muscles set
for action, Johnny dropped on his knees, and,
shutting one eye, peered through the narrow
opening.</p>
<p>What he saw astonished him. In a brilliantly
lighted room, the width of the car, and some ten
feet deep, four men were working rapidly, and
apparently with great skill. What surprised him
most of all was that all four men wore heavily
smoked glasses, such as Pant himself wore. He
saw at a glance that neither the steam kettle
cook nor the midget clown was with them. He
was glad the cook was not there. His feeling
regarding the midget, after the events of the
previous day, was not unmixed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>The things the men were doing interested
him immensely. Two of them appeared to be
putting little squares of paper through a wash,
such as a photographer uses. A third was drying
them before a motor-driven, superheated
electric fan. The fourth was stamping them in
a small press. Each time he stamped one, he
appeared to change the type.</p>
<p>Presently, the two who were handling the
baths appeared to come to the end of their tasks.
Hardly had they spoken a word to their companions
than each man stepped to a corner, and,
turning his back from the center of the room,
stood there motionless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s lips formed the word.
There was not time to finish. The next instant
he dropped limply back upon the platform, as if
he had been shot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Johnny?&rdquo; Pant whispered in
alarm. Johnny&rsquo;s hands covered his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The flash! My eyes! They&rsquo;re blind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant pushed him roughly to one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny slid back to the other car platform.
Still dazed by the sudden flood of light that had
struck his eye, but fast recovering, he watched
Pant with interest, not unmingled with awe. By
the sudden spurts of light that shot through the
crack, he knew that the flashes were being continued,
yet Pant did not remove his eye. He
still crouched there before the crack. Gazing
intently within, he uttered now and then a
stifled &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; at the marvels which
he was viewing.</p>
<p>Finally he dropped back to a seat beside
Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eyes all right now?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. What was it?&rdquo; queried Johnny, forgetting
his aching eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Color photography.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Color photography?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. One of the great inventions of the
age, and they are using it for making counterfeit
bonds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; whispered Pant, &ldquo;great inventors
have been experimenting with color photography
for years. They got so they could do
color work on negatives&mdash;that is, the photographic
plate&mdash;very well. They have used these
for the purpose of photographing the stages of
certain diseases, and a few things like that; but
when it came to getting the color on the positive&mdash;the
picture itself&mdash;that could not be
done. These fellows <i>can do it</i>, and are doing it.
The bonds are printed in brown and black. They
catch these colors perfectly, only in a little paler
hue. Their paper is nearly perfect, but whatever
defects it has are counteracted by this color
photography which reproduces the very tints of
the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time they sat there in silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now that we know their game,&rdquo; whispered
Pant at last, &ldquo;how are we going to get them?
One of the fellows is a ticket seller. He sold
Snowball some bonds when we were in Chicago.
I might have known he was in it. Another is a
guard at the entrance of the big top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sold me some bonds once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. The other two I don&rsquo;t know.
Let&rsquo;s have another look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant had just put his eyes to the crack;
Johnny was standing behind him, when there
ran through the train a sickening shiver. The
next instant there followed a deafening crash,
as car jammed upon car, and, leaping high upon
one another, left the track.</p>
<p>It was a wreck&mdash;such a wreck as is seldom
witnessed&mdash;the wreck of a circus train; a head-end
collision with a bob-tailed freight running
like mad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>At the moment previous to the first shock of
the wreck, Gwen might have been seen sitting
in her own compartment talking earnestly with
the millionaire twins. None of the three had
yet undressed for retiring. The things the twins
were telling Gwen had much to do with Johnny
Thompson, and appeared to interest her very
much, for now and then there came an amused,
and again a surprised, twinkle in her eye. At
one time, a close observer might have seen her
slip a ring from her finger, a ring that had been
covered by the folds of her dress. The ring she
crowded deep into the pocket of her blouse beneath
her handkerchief.</p>
<p>When the wreck occurred, the car they were
in, a staunch steel affair, leaped high in air, then
wholly uninjured, left the track to topple over
on one side and lay there quite still.</p>
<p>Gwen had been shaken from her seat and
jammed beneath the one before her. The twins,
gripping the sides, held on as if riding a fractious
broncho, and were not shaken loose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Marjory, as the car settled to
rest, &ldquo;Johnny Thompson and our ponies! We
must find them. They may be killed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>The pair of them, sliding from their seats,
had crawled through a window, and were away
before Gwen could sufficiently recover her breath
to call them back. She wrung her hands in real
distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be killed!&rdquo; she cried frantically.
&ldquo;Half the lions and tigers in the circus must be
loose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she scrambled out of the car to find
Johnny Thompson. He would know what to do!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><br />CHAPTER XVII
<br />&ldquo;GET THAT BLACK CAT&rdquo;</h2>
<p>At the first shock of the wreck, Johnny
Thompson and Pant were thrown with such violence
against the express car door that the lock
was sprung, and they were pitched head foremost
among the surprised and panic-stricken
counterfeiters.</p>
<p>Pant was the first to regain his wits. The
car, like many others, had careened to one side
and lay there motionless. The instruments in
the room had been tossed about. Everyone was
splashed with a stinging fluid which came from
the vats. The peculiar instrument which had
occupied the center of the room, and was undoubtedly
the color-photo camera, an instrument
of priceless value, had apparently sustained little
injury. Pant seized upon this and was about
to dash through the door with it, when the large
man with the black moustache wrenched it from
his grasp, and, poising it for an instant in his
right hand, hurled it at Pant&rsquo;s head. Leaping
to one side, Pant barely escaped the blow. There
was a crash, followed by the tinkle of glass and
metal instruments.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>The next moment the big man shot suddenly
upward and fell back with a groan. Johnny&rsquo;s
good right hand had got him under the chin.
Two of the men leaped from the door and fled.
The one remaining sprang at Pant, but was at
once borne down by Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tear some of those wires from the wall,&rdquo;
panted Johnny. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tie them and drag them
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fat man, who was completely within their
power, was soon tied, then carried out of the
car to the embankment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for the other,&rdquo; puffed Johnny.</p>
<p>They dodged back into the car. To their
astonishment, they found that the other man had
escaped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; muttered Pant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Faked unconsciousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he was the prize bird of them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Pant appeared to remember something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; he whispered in a tense whisper,
&ldquo;Johnny, get that black cat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catching his breath, Johnny sprang from the
car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; whispered Pant. From his pocket
he had drawn a tiny vial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;may help you. It&rsquo;s
what they call cat-lick in India. An old Hindu
gave it to me after I had captured the big black
cat. He said it was like catnip to the cat. When
a tiger or leopard smelled it, if he could get
near the spot where a drop had been spilled he
forgot his savageness, and laid down to roll in
it. I&rsquo;m not sure. It sounds queer. Try it if
you must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got some?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go up track; you go down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right! And Johnny,&rdquo; Pant repeated, &ldquo;get
the black cat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny had scarcely turned from the car when
he almost ran into somebody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gwen!&rdquo; he exclaimed in surprise. &ldquo;What
you doing out here? Don&rsquo;t you know half the
beasts are loose? Listen to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The long drawn out roar of a lion sounded
above the wail of darkies, the neighing of ponies,
and the trumpeting of bull elephants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Johnny, but Johnny, nothing half so
terrible could ever have been dreamed of!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wreck? I know. Some people are almost
sure to have been killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the twins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. They were in the car with me
when the shock came. They were telling me
about&mdash;all about you. They got away while I
was freeing myself from the seats. Went to
find you and their ponies. Oh, Johnny, we must
find them quick!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny answered, &ldquo;but watch out for
the black cat, the leopard. He&rsquo;s a man-eater
from the jungle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;And I saw him not
a minute ago. He&rsquo;s loose from his cage. He
was crouching in the corner of the wreck. I
caught the gleam of his eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny started forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, you won&rsquo;t go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get him first.&rdquo; He drew an automatic
from his pocket. Then he walked steadily
forward, his keen eyes studying every dark
corner of the wreck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>Down the train lengths lights were flashing.
The keepers were searching out the cages, striving
to retain those animals which had not yet
escaped, and to locate those that were free.
The wooden cars of an ancient design which
carried the animals had been torn and crushed,
piled upon one another, until the wreck at this
point resembled a kindling pile. Here one heard
the splintering of boards, as some beast attempted
to free himself, and here the crash of
torn-up planks told that some loyal elephant
strove to free his mate. The whole scene was
one of wild confusion. Wildest, most terrifying
of all, came the occasional challenge of a great
cat of the jungle, now free to do the bidding of
his own wild will.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Hardly had Gwen turned, after Johnny had
hurried away, than she uttered a cry of dismay.
Creeping toward her, his wild eyes gleaming,
was a gaunt, yellow tiger. For a second she
was paralyzed with fear. And in that second
the cat made progress&mdash;now he was ten yards
away, now eight, now five.</p>
<p>What should she do? To turn, to attempt to
flee seemed futile. A tiger could run much
faster than she. He might leap as she turned.
Her heart stood still. Cold perspiration came
out upon her brow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>Just when hope seemed gone a strange thing
happened; a thing which had happened once before
under very different circumstances; a crimson
flash leaped out from the darkness and
played upon the tawny coat of the tiger.
Blinded, terrified, the beast shrank back, yet the
light still played full upon him. Leaping and
flaring like the light of a fire, it held the animal
at bay until the keepers came with chains and
led him away.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>When the twins jumped out of the car window
to go in search of Johnny Thompson and
their ponies, they stumbled down the embankment
to climb laboriously up again, and make
their way tripping and falling around wrecked
cars, from which came weird, wild sounds of
animals fighting for freedom.</p>
<p>Suddenly from beneath Marjory&rsquo;s feet there
sounded a queer chatter. Then something
clawed at her legs. With a wild scream, she
shook it from her. It was a monkey that had
escaped from his broken cage. Others could be
heard chattering to the right of them. Leaping
forward they were startled by a great bulk that
loomed unexpectedly before them in the dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>&ldquo;An elephant!&rdquo; screamed Margaret.</p>
<p>For a minute they hesitated; the next, they
leaped to one side and, having passed the elephant,
continued on down the track. Always to
the left of them there loomed the overturned
cars. All at once, from beneath the wheels of
one of these there came a piercing scream. At
the same instant they caught the gleam of two
red balls of fire glaring at them out of the blackness.
Some fierce, wild creature was lurking
there. And he moved. Stealthily he made his
way toward them. Now he was away from the
cars. A black spot, he glided forward, his glaring
eyes seeming to grow larger and larger as
he advanced.</p>
<p>Seized with a sudden paralysis of fear, the
twins stood rooted in their tracks.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>With a little gasp Gwen sank upon the ground.
She looked in vain for the crimson flash. It was
gone. And now, for the first time she realized
that she did not know the direction whence it
had come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>After leaving Gwen, Johnny Thompson made
his way cautiously along the uneven embankment.
Now his eye caught a gleam that appeared
to come from the great cat&rsquo;s eyes. It
proved but the reflection of some polished object.
Again he heard a rattle among splintered
boards, only to find a colored roustabout climbing
from the pile of broken lumber under which
he had been buried. Johnny was just beginning
to believe that he had missed both the black beast
and the twins when something leaped at him out
of the darkness.</p>
<p>It took him but a second to realize that this
was not a wild beast, but a man; the king of
the counterfeiters.</p>
<p>Taken by surprise, he went down with the
man upon his back. At the same instant he
caught the gleam of a knife in the outlaw&rsquo;s hand.
There could be not one shadow of doubt that he
meant murder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>A terrible struggle followed. The man, fully
fifty pounds heavier than Johnny, was at the
same time agile and strong. Now the knife was
poised in air, only to be dashed to the ground.
Now Johnny secured a half-nelson. Now his
hold was broken. And now Johnny was thrown
to earth with such force as to render him half
unconscious. Struggling against a terrible dizziness,
he fought but feebly. The end seemed to
have come.</p>
<p>But, at that moment, there came a shrill
voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here, Johnny Thompson! I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One moment the knife poised above his chest;
the next a diminutive figure attached itself to
the arm that held the knife and sent it whirling
to one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Stick, the midget clown!&rdquo; gasped
Johnny, renewing his struggle for freedom.</p>
<p>Dimly in the half light, he saw what followed.
Turning all his attention to this new enemy, the
counterfeiter appeared to seize the dwarf by the
heels and dash him with terrible force against
the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>Then, almost instantly, a great, brown bulk
lumbered in out of the blackness, and at that
instant, with a gurgling cry, the counterfeiter
appeared to rise in air to be sent crashing again
and again against the side of the embankment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jo-Jo, the French elephant, Tom Stick&rsquo;s
friend!&rdquo; cried Johnny, leaping to his feet to
bend over the prostrate form of his little defender.</p>
<p>Two attendants came hurrying up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Tom Stick,&rdquo; explained Johnny. &ldquo;That
other fellow&rsquo;s dead. The big bull elephant killed
him. And right it was. He deserved it. Look
after Tom. I&rsquo;ve got to find the twins and the
black cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more, after recovering his automatic,
which had been thrown from him in the first
assault of the counterfeiter, he leaped away into
the dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>He was not a moment too soon, for as he
dropped down from a pile of tumbled bales of
canvas he came face to face with the twins.
They were standing wild-eyed, transfixed. Not
ten yards away and within leaping distance, his
tail lashing, his white fangs gleaming, was the
great black cat.</p>
<p>With uncommon coolness Johnny grasped his
automatic and, taking careful aim at the spot
between the creature&rsquo;s fiery eyes, grasped the
handle tight. There came a metallic click, but
no report. The gun had jammed&mdash;was utterly
useless. With a cry of consternation, Johnny
dropped the gun and reached for his clasp knife.
Thus poorly armed, he was about to rush at the
man-eater, when there came the sudden glare
of red light as it played upon the great cat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crimson flash! Thank God!&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>But the next instant he remembered the words
of Pant, when he had told of his jungle experience:
&ldquo;He did not fear my charm; he leaped!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What now would be the outcome? It was a
time of terrible suspense. Johnny&rsquo;s breath came
in little gasps. One of the twins had dropped to
the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>There was not long to wait. Whirling, the
cat leaped away to the right. Then, for the first
time, Johnny saw that the crimson flash came
directly from a dark bulk, a clump of bushes
close to the track. There had been no time for
tricks, Pant had flashed it direct, and he was
there now. The great cat would be upon him in
another minute.</p>
<p>Even as he sprang after the cat, Johnny
thought for the first time of the magic perfume,
the cat-lick Pant had given him. Drawing this
from his pocket, he uncorked it as he ran. He
was not a second too soon. Already the beast&rsquo;s
fangs were at Pant&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p>With mad hope beating at his heart,
Johnny dashed a few drops of the precious perfume
at the beast&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Prepared as he was for miracles, he was
astounded at the result. The wild beast became
at once a mere house kitten rolling upon the
ground. Over and over he tumbled, while Pant,
limping painfully, crept away.</p>
<p>Throwing a glance about him, Johnny saw
Tom Stick&rsquo;s house to the right of him, and remembered
how it had been built around a cage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Door&rsquo;s still on the hinges and open,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;If I only can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six steps he took, and with each step, spilled
a drop of the precious fluid. Then, with a
breathless leap, he was inside the dwarf&rsquo;s house.
Dashing the vial against the wall, he caught his
breath at the thought that the cat might trap
him here; then with a wilder leap than before,
he cleared the door and breathed the outer air.</p>
<p>He was not a second too soon. Hot on the
trail of that burst of perfume, the cat flashed
past him and into the house that was a cage.</p>
<p>Johnny banged the door shut and barred it,
then sank down upon the ground for a quiet
breath.</p>
<p>Soon he rose and, making his way to the
bushes, examined the spot where the black cat
had pinned Pant to the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>As he flashed a light about, he uttered a low
exclamation, and stooping, picked up the bent
and lenseless ruins of Pant&rsquo;s glasses. He
dropped these a second later to gather up a mass
of fine wires and strangely tangled tubes and
peculiar instruments. These he crammed into
his jacket pocket, and, having cast one more
glance about him, hastened away to find the
twins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><br />CHAPTER XVIII
<br />HOW JOHNNY GOT THE RING</h2>
<p>The first red streaks of dawn were appearing
as Johnny sat down on the beam of a railroad
bridge a quarter of a mile from the wreck.</p>
<p>It had been a strange, wild night. Many
startling things had happened; many mysteries
had been solved. Now that these mysteries were
uncovered he had come down here to think.</p>
<p>Tom Stick was not one of the counterfeiters;
he knew that now. Neither was the steam kettle
cook, nor the conman with the ragged ear. The
real culprits had attempted to cast the guilt upon
them, that was all. The arch criminal, Black
McCree, was dead. Jo-Jo, the elephant, had
thrashed the life out of him when McCree had
attempted to murder his master, the midget
clown. The fat accomplice of Black McCree
had confessed that his partner was that notorious
criminal. He had denied having any
knowledge of the working of that strange color-photo
camera. Black McCree had chosen to
take that secret with him to the other world.
Pant had turned the whole matter over to two
of his assistants and had disappeared. That the
remains of the camera could be pieced together
was doubtful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>In the struggle with Black McCree, Tom
Stick had been beaten into unconsciousness, and
had suffered severe bruises, but would be back
at his work in two or three weeks.</p>
<p>The twins had been taken to a near-by farm
house, where they were safe for the night.
Fortunately, their ponies had come out of the
wreck uninjured. In an hour or two Johnny
would accompany them to their grandparents&rsquo;
home. Should he return to the circus? He
doubted it. The mystery of the whereabouts of
the diamond ring was yet unsolved. Gwen had
had it. So had Millie. He half blamed himself
for not demanding the right to keep it when it
was in his own hand. But Gwen was such a
good sport. He had hoped a more appropriate
time might come. Now he believed he would
go to his former employer and make the best of
an unbelievable story. He made a wry face at
thought of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>But Pant? He had disappeared again. Johnny
had not seen him after the fight with the black
cat. Mother Kelly had dressed his wounds,
which were slight, and he had vanished.</p>
<p>At thought of Pant, Johnny dug into his
pocket and drew forth the mass of wires, tubes
and instruments which he had picked up on the
spot where the cat had attacked Pant.</p>
<p>He toyed with this mass musingly. He
thought it had dropped from Pant&rsquo;s pocket.
&ldquo;Some part of the counterfeiters&rsquo; equipment,&rdquo;
was his mental comment. Twisting the wires
about, he turned a thumb-screw here, pushed a
tiny lever there, pressed a bulb&mdash;when, of a
sudden, his eyes were struck by a blinding flash
of blood red light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>His unnerved fingers released the mass of
wires, tubes and instruments, and the next instant
his startled eyes saw it disappear beneath
the muddy waters of the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crimson flash!&rdquo; he moaned. &ldquo;And I
had the secret of it here within my grasp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time he considered the possibilities
of recovering it, then dismissed the thought as
futile.</p>
<p>Then for a while he sat there speculating on
the strange phenomenon of the crimson flash.
How had Pant achieved these wonders? Where
had he worn this mass of delicate instruments?
There were times when the flash had come and
gone with the speed of the blink of an eye.
Perhaps the switch had been attached to Pant&rsquo;s
eyelid. Such things had been done. Yet, all
this was speculation. Johnny shook his mind
free from it. Speculation is always futile.</p>
<p>He was about to rise and return to the wreck,
which was even now assuming the appearance
of a train again, when he heard footsteps approaching.</p>
<p>It was Gwen. Johnny rose to meet her as she
came toward him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Mr. Clown,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;I want
to talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good old clown,&rdquo; she smiled again,
as they seated themselves, &ldquo;even if you did come
near breaking your neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody fired the balloons with arrows
shot from an air rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. I thought it was Tom Stick, but it
wasn&rsquo;t. He saved my life last night. Guess
someone must have stolen his air rifle to pull
the trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was about to say,&rdquo; continued Gwen,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re a good old clown, and just for that I
want to give you something. So, &lsquo;open your
mouth and shut your eyes, and I&rsquo;ll give you
something to make you wise.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady there,&rdquo; warned Johnny, as he cupped
his hands solidly together. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s of any value
don&rsquo;t drop it. I&rsquo;ve lost one secret in the river
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s valuable, all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Johnny felt something touch his hand. The
instant his fingers closed upon it, he knew what
it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ring!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;The twins
told me all about it last night. Of course we
didn&rsquo;t know it was yours, or we wouldn&rsquo;t have
kept it. When we first found it, we three girls
thought it was glass. When we discovered it
was a real diamond, we were already in Chicago
and didn&rsquo;t know what to do, so we just kept it,
and took turns wearing it. But Johnny, when
you had it in your hands that day, why didn&rsquo;t
you keep it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; smiled Johnny.
&ldquo;I guess you were such a good sport I hated to
lose you as a friend, and I hoped a better time
would come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has come, Johnny; but something tells me
I am the one to lose a pal. You&rsquo;ll leave the
circus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny admitted reluctantly. &ldquo;I
guess I&rsquo;m going to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always the way with a person who is
used to living in a house,&rdquo; sighed Gwen. &ldquo;The
circus is for circus people. Anyway, I can wish
you good luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rose. She put out her hand. He gripped
it heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Johnny, if ever the big top calls to you,
just remember the outfit I&rsquo;m with, and there&rsquo;ll
be a job waiting for you. I&rsquo;ll want you for my
clown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned and walked rapidly away.</p>
<p>Johnny watched her for a moment, then,
crossing the bridge, made his way toward the
farm house where the twins were awaiting him.
He would escort them back to a safe dwelling
place; the ring should be returned to them, and
if possible, he was resolved that the circus career
of the millionaire twins should be a secret shared
only by those to whom it was already known.</p>
